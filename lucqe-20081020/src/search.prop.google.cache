Name: Email: Crime is defined by the Merriam-Webster dictionary as
an act or the commission of an act that is forbidden or the omission of a duty that is commanded by a public law and that makes the offender liable to punishment by that law.   Laws are designed to protect us and ensure our safety in all aspects of our lives: physical, financial, psychological and social.  Yet not a day does go by that we don’t hear of crimes taking place in our city or state.  When a crime is committed, public safety becomes endangered and specific individuals or groups may feel violated.  While we would like to avoid such events, they take place all too often.  Here are some statistics that demonstrate this:
Every two
minutes, somewhere in America, someone is sexually assaulted.
In 2002, there were a total of 4,854 cases of aggravated assault in
Washington DC.  On a daily basis, this computes to 13.2 aggravated assaults a day.
In Maryland, there were 3,228 cases of larceny and thefts per 100,000 people in 2002.  This is one-third higher than the national average rate of 2,445.8 cases per 100,000.
In Detroit, there were 41.79 murders per 100,000 people in 2002.  This is alarmingly way above the national average rate of 5.6 for the same year.
In 2002, with the exception of burglaries, Philadelphia
led all crime levels which were above the national average rates for murder, forcible rape, robbery, aggravated assaults, larceny/theft and motor vehicle theft.
To find out more crime statistics in the
US, visit the
University of Michigan Library.
In addition to crimes against individuals,   
Corporate crime
has recently jolted the corporate world with the likes of the
Enron
scandal and the
Martha Stewart
arrest.  Across
America, worker rights are often violated by threats of firing and other reprisals made to those who dare to exercise their lawful right to collective bargaining and unions.   In 2000, when a department of meat cutters at a Wal-Mart center in
Texas
voted 7-3 in favor of unionization, Wal-Mart eliminated the meat cutting department, choosing instead to pre-cut meats, resulting in the elimination of meat cutting jobs nationwide.  The garment and fabric factories
of
New York
are filled with immigrant workers, many of whom do not have proper working documents. Many of these workers end up enduring poor working conditions for fear of deportation and
INS
investigations, encouraged by the factory owners.  Through collective bargaining, unions protect the rights of workers by giving them fair representation in the work place.  On the contrary, some union leaders have been charged for their involvement in crime activities (racketeering, fraud and tax evasion, embezzlement, and extortion).  Union or not, corporate crime exists on both ends of the continuum, where the workers continue to be victimized and their rights violated.   
Another major type of crime is terrorism.  The tragic events of 9/11 and the terrorists that brought on those acts of destruction have changed the lives of Americans forever.  Support the
fight against terrorism.  
The War on Drugs
deals with addressing the violation of drug laws.  Tremendous resources have been devoted and spent on this war, locally and internationally.  The recent extradition
of drug criminal Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela to the
US
is a sign that indeed the
US
is continuing to wage a war against drug crime.
Social and Economic Problems Caused by Crime
Our social and economic problems are often a direct result of crime.  In a vicious circle, these problems can fuel crime even more.  For example, those who commit theft and burglaries often do so because of their need for money.  These individuals may be unemployed, incapable of finding work, homeless, sick or impoverished.  These crimes become a tempting way to quickly acquire money.  Unfortunately, when left unpunished, these individuals get the misconception that crime pays.  It is this thinking that encourages some individuals to continue their criminal ways, discouraging them from finding other activities that would give them some normality and stability in their lives.  This way of thinking reinforces crime.
Another crime, prostitution, is frequently associated with drug addiction.  Many prostitutes find it difficult to change their work because of their drug addiction.  Drugs require significant cash and prostitution provides this, faster and easier than legitimate work.  Prostitution often will lead to other crimes such as
people trafficking,
sexual abuse, and rape.  Those who exploit women often have no regard for people’s lives.  This disregard often leads to physical abuse and even murder.  In addition, prostitution can increase the spread of diseases such as AIDS, other
STD’s and hepatitis. 
On a larger scale, drug addiction fuels the illicit drug industry.  Through our web site War on Drugs, you can learn more about the social and economic problems that drugs cause.  In organized crime, you will find other violations related to drug trafficking.  These include money laundering, smuggling and illegal sale of weapons, credit card fraud and counterfeiting.  Poverty often leads to the problem of homelessness.  Those who live on the streets often experience hunger and disease making them more likely to resort to committing theft and burglary as a means to eat or to obtain medicine.  Out on the streets the homeless
are exposed more to the risks of drug addiction and other unwanted social behaviors.  All of these factors fuel crime.
Solving the Root Causes of Crime
In order to eradicate crime, we need to address the root causes.  These include, but are not limited to, greed, inadequate corporate oversight, poverty, lack of education, homelessness, drug addiction, racial hatred, and lax gun laws.  Education is one of the biggest factors that plays a role in what becomes of an individual in their adulthood.  Those who have an education possess the training and skills needed to make them marketable to potential employers.  Indeed, even for jobs that pay only a minimum wage, employers likely will prefer interviewing candidates with a decent education over those without.  Thus, many of the uneducated may find themselves unemployed, living in sub-standard housing and in impoverished conditions.  And as money becomes scarce, many of them might be tempted to engage in criminal activities.  At Grassroots.org, we encourage everyone to pursue formal education and stress the importance of governments and universities helping make it accessible to all.  We strongly believe that every American citizen deserves an education and it’s especially important to make it more available to those families who are not able to readily afford it. Education can help eradicate poverty, which will in turn reduce the crime rate.
Poverty often pushes children to drop out of school.  Those children who do not attend school may end up roaming the streets, exposing themselves to criminal elements and activities.  This is why it is imperative that communities provide safe places where children can gather inside, away from street life.  These include school clubs, youth clubs, and sports and recreational centers where children and youth are given support and supervision through educational and developmental programs.  Without alternatives to schools, children can easily get involved in petty crimes such as shoplifting, residential break-ins, car theft and vandalism.  After the petty crimes, these children may graduate into the more serious crimes of drug trafficking, sexual offences and gang violence.
Crime can also be related to the probability of being caught and the extent of possible sentencing.  On our web site Sexual Abuse, we present information showing that most rapes and most acts of sexual abuse are committed by individuals with whom the victims are related or otherwise acquainted.  Such relationships can discourage victims from reporting incidents to law enforcement agencies, thus failing to bring the culprits to justice.  Part of the underreporting problem is the social stigma that is attached to these victims.  Although they are victims, they are often blamed for the crime, labelled as being promiscuous and loose.  This allows the real offenders to get away unpunished, leaving them free to offend again.  As citizens, we need to adopt laws and reporting procedures that will give full physical and psychological protection to victims who report crime.  Let us not allow offenders to get away with their crimes, giving them an opportunity to repeat.
Corporate crime is becoming increasingly global and its consequences can be devastating.  Consumers are defrauded.  Our environment (soil, air and water) is often compromised.  Our personal safety can be placed at risk by lobbyists who buy influence but do not have the interest of the greater majority at heart.  A case in point is the
Federal Ban on Assault Weapons.  The National Rifle Association, a powerful lobbyist organization that opposes the federal ban, including background checks at gun shows, has been a very large donor of money to political parties since 1989.  Although the federal ban and background checks help to ensure our safety, these two issues remain unresolved today.  Visit our web site
Lobbyists
for a more thorough discussion on influence buying.  Scandals such as the Enron accounting fraud have resulted in job loss, pension loss, investment loss, a negative impact on the confidence of the American public on the corporate system, loss of taxes due to the Treasury and more.  Today, as reported by
Citizen Works, there are many other corporations today being investigated for irregular accounting practices.  A few examples are K-Mart, Qwest Communications, WorldCom and Xerox.
We must work to curtail corporate greed.  The practice of “influence buying” needs to be stopped.  Corporations must have tighter controls over their accounting reporting procedures.  We call for greater transparency as well so that irregularities in accounting practices can be detected early to mitigate any damages.  The practice of corporate disclosure needs to be widened.  This will allow consumers and shareholders to become fully aware of corporate records on the environment, human rights, worker safety and financial matters.  It will also allow us to know about corporate criminal records and litigation records.  Multiple functions within consulting firms need to be severed and made independent from each other to prevent conflicts of interest.  The Arthur Andersen firm was caught in such a conflict in the Enron scandal, as the firm served both as the accountants and consultants for Enron.  Arthur Andersen was later found guilty of obstruction of justice.  The company was essentially shut down by that and other accounting scandals.
Our prison rehabilitation and prison systems need reform.  A
report
published by the Urban Institute confirms that although the number of parolees regularly being released from our prison system is large, the number of them going back into prison is alarming.  In 1980, as many as 27,000 parolee violators returned to prisons. By 2000, this number increased to 203,000.  This amount represents a 652 percent increase.  There are a number of reasons for this:
Continuing social problems drive parolees back to crime. 
The number of parole officers is not enough to handle the demand of case loads. 
Educational and vocational programs for inmates in prisons need improvement.
Prison personnel need more training in prison based inmate rehabilitation.  This will ensure a higher success rate of inmate re-integration in to society.  Many private prisons have high staff turnover, chronic understaffing and inexperienced correctional officers.  These private prisons are focused primarily on profit, with the inmates being secondary concerns.
If those in charge of our prison system give priority first and foremost to the rehabilitation and re-integration of inmates, this in turn will have a positive effect on the reduction of crime.
Calls to Action
As law abiding citizens, it is imperative that we live our lives according to the rules of our land.  It is also our civic duty to report any crimes that we witness.  The reasons are simple: our laws are meant to preserve the quiet and peaceful enjoyment of living in this great country of the
United States.  Anytime a law is broken, it can compromise the safety of our citizens.  What makes our nation so great is the freedom given to us by our forefathers: our freedom of speech, of religion, of protest, to vote, to get an education, to go to work, to information and many more!  These freedoms are valuable and precious to all of us.  These freedoms are the reasons why the
UShas waged several battles on crime including the War on Drugs and the War on Terrorism. 
Although the costs of these battles are plenty, the rewards are worth it.   9/11 has changed our lives forever, no doubt.  Today, there are Americans who still live in fear of when and where the next terrorist attacks will happen.  Immediately after the strikes on the
World
Trade
Center, such fear was overwhelming and widespread.  There is great debate on whether the
US
is winning the war in
Iraq.  Many question whether our soldiers should even be there.  However, there is no question that 9/11 has not repeated itself in
USsoil. There is also no question in our minds that the War on Drugs is having a positive effect given the fall and extradition of many Colombian drug lords.  Grassroots.org is asking you to support our law enforcement agencies.  Give encouragement to those who put their lives on the line to protect our freedoms.  And most importantly, let each of us live according to the laws of our nation.  Democracy is powerful.  Freedom makes the war on crime even more worth it!

Background information
Conference of the Parties
Address by Ambassador Luigi Lauriola, Chairman of the Ad Hoc Committee on The Elaboration of a Convention Against Transnational Organized Crime at The Millenium Assembly of the United Nations General Assembly, New York, November 2000 The Convention represents a major step forward in the fight against transnational organized crime and signifies the recognition of UN Member States that this is a serious and growing problem that can only be solved through close international cooperation. The Convention, concluded at the 10th session of the Ad Hoc Committee established by the General Assembly to deal with this problem, is a legally binding instrument committing States that ratify it to taking a series of measures against transnational organized crime. These include the creation of domestic criminal offences to combat the problem, and the adoption of new, sweeping frameworks for mutual legal assistance, extradition, law-enforcement cooperation and technical assistance and training. States Parties will be able to rely on one another in investigating, prosecuting and punishing crimes committed by organized criminal groups where either the crimes or the groups who commit them have some element of transnational involvement. This should make it much more difficult for offenders and organized criminal groups to take advantage of gaps in national law, jurisdictional problems or a lack of accurate information about the full scope of their activities. The Convention deals with the fight against organized crime in general and some of the major activities in which transnational organized crime is commonly involved, such as money laundering, corruption and the obstruction of investigations or prosecutions. To supplement the Convention, two Protocols also tackle specific areas of transnational organized crime that are of particular concern to UN Member States. The Protocol against the Smuggling of Migrants deals with the growing problem of organized criminal groups who smuggle migrants, often at high risk to the migrants and at great profit for the offenders. The Protocol against Trafficking in Persons deals with the problem of modern slavery, in which the desire of people to seek a better life is taken advantage of by organized criminal groups. Migrants are often confined or coerced into exploitive or oppressive forms of employment, often in the sex trade or in dangerous occupations, with the illicit incomes generated from these activities going to organized crime. The Protocols also commit countries which ratify them to making the basic subject of the Protocol a criminal offence and to adopting other specific measures, such as controls on travel documents, to combat the problem. These supplement the more general measures found in the Convention, and countries must become parties to the Convention itself before they can become parties to any of the Protocols. A third Protocol, dealing with the illicit manufacturing of and trafficking in firearms, parts and components, and ammunition, remains under discussion. The texts of these documents were developed over 11 sessions of the Ad Hoc Committee, and footnoted texts may be found under each session. The Convention was finalized at the 10th session, and the complete text forms part of the Report of that session. The Protocols dealing with the smuggling of migrants and trafficking in persons were finalized at the 11th session and are reported there. These three instruments were adopted by the UN Millenium General Assembly on 15 November 2000, and final texts are included in the Report of that session. Instruments Finalized instruments: United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime and following protocols: Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children, supplementing the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime Protocol against the Smuggling of Migrants by Land, Air and Sea, supplementing the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime (PDF) English,

Organized Crime
This compilation of resources focuses on adult gangs, gangsters, the mafia, and international gangs. For more information about youth gangs, look under Gangs. "Transnational organized crime will be one of the major problems facing policy makers in the 21st century. It will be a defining issue of the 21st century as the Cold War was for the 20th century and Colonialism was for the 19th. No area of international affairs will remain untouched as political and economic systems and the social fabric of many countries will deteriorate under the increasing financial power of international organized crime groups." -Louise Shelley, Director of TraCCC.

http://www.nagia.org/Crips_and_Bloods.htm
Surprisingly, little has been written about the historical significance of black gangs in Los Angeles (LA). Literature and firsthand interviews with Los Angeles residents seem to point to three significant periods relevant to the development of the contemporary black gangs. The first period, which followed WWII and significant black migrations from the South, is when the first major black clubs formed. After the Watts rebellion of 1965, the second period gave way to the civil rights period of Los Angeles where blacks, including those who where former club members who became politically active for the remainder of the 1960s. By the early 1970s black street gangs began to reemerge. By 1972, the Crips were firmly established and the Bloods were beginning to organize. This period saw the rise of LA’s newest gangs, which continued to grow during the 1970s, and later formed in several other cities throughout the United States by the 1990s. While black gangs do not make up the largest or most active gang population in Los Angeles today, their influence on street gang culture nationally has been profound. Article by Alejandro A. Alonso.

http://www.nagia.org/Hybrid_Gangs.htm
As the "gangsta" culture continues to spread throughout North America, the influence of California and Chicago gangs are now being felt in both large metropolitan areas and with increasing frequency in small, rural communities. The lesson has been well-learned that the problem of street gangs is one that touches all ethnic and socio-economic classes. However, as law enforcement agencies have attempted to deal with the gang problem in their respective communities, some very significant differences have been discovered from the historic perception of these gangs, and their behaviors in areas outside of Chicago or Los Angeles.

http://usinfo.state.gov/regional/ea/chinaaliens/polishprof.htm
Paper delivered by Professor Emil W. Plywaczewski, Ph.D., at the 3rd Annual Symposium "Crime and Its Control in Greater China", June 21-22, 2002, University of Hong Kong, PRC. Summary: Chinese organized crime has become well established in every major Chinese community across the world, Plywaczewski says. Members include community leaders as well as ordinary workers. "It is difficult to penetrate this subculture," Plywaczewski writes, "because members have no prior criminal records.... They can conceal their criminal activities through their involvement in lawful business activities." Plywaczewski provides detailed information on Chinese people-smuggling operations in Austria, Hungary, Poland and other European countries. He notes that Chinese criminal groups operate in isolated "cells," each with a specific duty and unaware of other cells in the criminal operation except the one from which it accepts assignments. In the case of people smuggling, some organizations will, for a higher fee, provide their "customers" with "a guarantee of effectiveness." That is, the smugglers guarantee that they will get their client to a target country no matter how many times they might be stopped by law enforcement.

http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/nij/international/chinese.html
The organizational structure of Chinese organized crime in the United States is quite complex. Broadly defined, there is a great variety of Chinese criminal organizations. These include gangs, secret societies, triads, tongs, Taiwanese organized crime groups, and strictly US-based tongs and gangs. According to Ko-lin Chin, the foremost academic expert in the U.S. on Chinese organized crime, there is no empirical support for the belief that there is a well-organized, monolithic, hierarchical criminal cartel called the "Chinese Mafia." Chin says: "My findings...do not support the notion that a chain of command exists among these various crime groups or that they coordinate with one another routinely in international crimes such as heroin trafficking, money laundering, and the smuggling of aliens" (1996:123).

http://www.fbi.gov/hq/cid/orgcrime/ocshome.htm
Organized crime, in the U.S. and around the world, is a critical concern of the law enforcement community. The cooperation among these organized criminal enterprises in recent years has allowed them to greatly increase the scope and magnitude of their illicit activities. Our world has seen widespread and unprecedented political, economic, social, and technological changes in the last two decades. Organized criminal enterprises have been quick to take advantage of the opportunities created by these changes to satisfy their greed and lust for power. The cost to communities and individuals, in terms of pain and suffering caused by the violence and exploitation associated with these organizations, is incalculable. Also the damage to society resulting from these criminal organizations and their influence on labor unions, political institutions, financial markets, and major industries is immeasurable. In fact, a look at the economic impact alone gives a glimpse of the importance of this issue. The Center for Strategic and International Studies, Global Organized Crime Project, Financial Crimes Task Force estimates global organized crime reaps profits of close to $1 trillion per year. The FBI's fight against organized crime is unlike other criminal programs. Instead of focusing on these crimes as individual events, the FBI's Organized Crime Program targets the entire organization responsible for a variety of criminal activities. The FBI has found that even if key individuals in an organization are removed, the depth and financial strength of the organization often allows the enterprise to continue.

The rapid spread of international crime since the end of the Cold War is unprecedented in scale, facilitated by globalization and technological advances, and poses a significant challenge to the United States and democratic governments and free market economies around the world. The President has identified international crime as a direct and immediate threat to the national security of the United States. To meet this challenge, the Departments of Justice, State, and Treasury--working closely with numerous federal agencies--jointly developed a comprehensive national strategy to fight international crime and reduce its impact on Americans. The International Crime Control Strategy, which was released in May 1998, provides a dynamic action plan that serves as a roadmap for a coordinated, effective, long-term attack on international crime.

This web page is intended to address global organized crime and it's growing importance for international security. This issue is emerging in international relations as a primary component in security and foreign policy making. Global organized crime activities are elusive because many global orgainzed crime groups operate through a variety of high tech means, which are difficult to trace. The groups operations have global implications such as illegal biological, nuclear, and chemical weapons trade. With the high stakes of global organized crime it is imperative that the international community develop a means to deal with these issues.

La Cosa Nostra or LCN -- also known as the Mafia, the mob, the outfit, the office -- is a collection of Italian-American organized crime “families” that has been operating in the United States since the 1920s. For nearly three quarters of a century, beginning during the time of Prohibition and extending into the 1990s, the LCN was clearly the most prominent criminal organization in the U.S. Indeed, it was synonymous with organized crime. In recent years, the LCN has been severely crippled by law enforcement, and over the past decade has been challenged in a number of its criminal markets by other organized crime groups. Nevertheless, with respect to those criteria that best define the harm capacity of criminal organizations, it is still pre-eminent. The LCN has greater capacity to gain monopoly control over criminal markets, to use or threaten violence to maintain that control, and to corrupt law enforcement and the political system than does any of its competitors. As one eminent scholar has also pointed out, “no other criminal organization [in the United States] has controlled labor unions, organized employer cartels, operated as a rationalizing force in major industries, and functioned as a bridge between the upperworld and the underworld” (Jacobs, 1999:128). It is this capacity that distinguishes the LCN from all other criminal organizations in the U.S. James O. Finckenauer, Ph.D., National Institute of Justice.

http://www.rcmp.ca/ccaps/media_e.htm
The Canadian public is exposed to extensive media coverage of events related to organized crime (OC). Every day, an impressive array of stories appear in both print and broadcast media. A study carried out last year estimated at more than 27,000 the number of articles that referred to organized crime in 15 Canadian dailies and magazines over a six-year period (Beare & Ronderos, 2001). This massive exposure is significant, as the media are among the sources of information people count on to mould their opinion of the world around them. And with respect to crime, surveys have shown that up to 95% of people say they rely on the media as their primary source of information in this regard (Graber, 1979). Given the extensive OC media coverage here in Canada and its role as a possible source of public information in this regard, it seems imperative that we answer the following question: Does media coverage of OC-related events influence public opinion, and, if so, how?

(Last checked 06/15/04) Media Coverage of Organized Crime : Police Managers Survey
http://www.rcmp.ca/ccaps/media_coverage_e.htm
Police managers feel that the media tend to focus too much on organized crime activities that involve violence. Because of this emphasis on violence and sensationalism, the media often underplay organized crime activities with no apparent violence. The activities downplayed the most by the media, in terms of impact, are money laundering and economic crimes. Police managers also stated that the media give too much exposure to positive or socially acceptable events linked to organized crime. They consider, however, that police operations, trials and political interventions related to organized crime receive adequate and relatively proper coverage. Police managers are concerned about a lack of in-depth articles, editorials and feature stories that could provide an in-depth look at issues related organized crime. According to some managers, the biggest shortcoming is that the media never provide a comprehensive view of the actual causes and overall impact of organized crime in Canada.

http://www.nagia.org/Motorcycle_Gangs.htm
Once considered nothing more than rowdy toughs on two-wheelers, motorcycle gangs have evolved into crime units that are sufficiently well-oiled and well-organized to rival the Mafia. It's not just police officers who lump these groups together. Documented evidence in state, provincial and federal courts throughout the United States, Canada, Europe and Australia suggests that motorcycle gangs have become organized crime entities equal to the Mafia on many fronts. Biker gangs are organized internationally, with chapters in Europe, Australia, South America and Africa. As retired Illinois State Police Sergeant Joe Satercier noted in 1993 at a Chicago-area Outlaw Motorcycle Gang training seminar, "Biker gangs are the only sophisticated organized crime groups that we export from the United States."

http://www.sgc.gc.ca/publications/policing/1998orgcrim_e.asp
Over the past few years in Canada and around the world the topic of organized crime (OC) has attracted increased concern and attention. With this concern has come the need to better understand the phenomenon in its entirety. While many OC studies have been produced that describe or examine a particular OC activity or OC group, relatively little attention has been focused in any systematic way on the impact of OC on Canada, Canadians and their communities. The Organized Crime Impact Study (OCIS) addresses this issue. It does so not by focusing on OC groups but rather on the impact of key activities, such as the illicit drug trade, that organized criminals participate in and help sustain. Highlights from a study by Samuel Porteous for the Solicitor General Canada. The first attempt to measure the impact of organized crime on Canada.

The third section addresses the underground economy in the latter years of the Soviet Union as the framework from which the current Russian mafia, the subject of the fourth section, developed.

Russian organized crime constitutes a direct threat to the national security interests of the United States by fostering instability in a nuclear-armed power. Left unchecked, Russia is in jeopardy of becoming a criminal syndicalist state under the control of corrupt government bureaucrats, politicians, quasi-businessmen, and criminals. Composed of senior-level U.S. government representatives and private-sector experts, the task force assesses the breadth and depth of Russian organized crime and corruption, addresses current U.S. policy, and makes recommendations on how best to confront these challenges.

It describes the fascination of the American press with all newly-emerging criminal enterprises and asks several functionalist questions concerning the possible ramifications of this interest.

The formerly daunting notion of conversing or conducting business with someone halfway around the globe is now a mouse-click or a telephone call away.

A report by the United Kingdom National Criminal Intelligence Service on organized crime. (Last checked 06/15/04) United Kingdom Threat Assessment, 2001, Second Edition
http://www.ncis.co.uk/threat_assessment.html
This report gives a picture of serious criminal activity with organized crime groups (OCGs) involved in a diverse range of crime sectors, with the aim 'first and foremost to make money'. As well as traditional high-profile crimes such as drug-trafficking, robberty, extortion, theft and fraud, there is increasing concern over intellectual property theft (IPT) -- both in its own right and contributing to other criminality. The report draws attention to the sheer scale and complexity of counterfeiting -- especially of consumer goods - whether they are manufctured in the UK or in the cheap labor markets of the Far East. While UK Conterfeiting is often perceived as an activity by low level criminals, counterfeiting is, in fact, highly profitalbe and has a hevy involvement by organized criminals in the 'production, buying, importing and distribution of all types of counterefeited products'. The other misperception is that counterfeiting does not merit priority attention by law enforcement agencies but the report highlights that "the profits from IPT can help OCGs to become more established and to fund other various criminal activities'.

Grave crime is no longer bound by the constraints of borders. Such offenses as terrorism, nuclear smuggling, organized crime, computer crime, and drug trafficking can spill over from other countries into the United States. Regardless of origin, these and other overseas crimes impact directly on our citizens and our economy. We have developed a variety of anti-crime efforts both here and abroad to combat these dangerous threats. This effort has been undertaken with the support of the President, Attorney General Janet Reno, and Secretary Warren Christopher. One of the most effective ways to fight international crime is by building cop-to-cop bridges between American law enforcement and our overseas counterparts. Without these relationships, there cannot be the commonality of purpose and open communication required for success. More and more of these bridges are being built, and successes are flowing from them. We are using a number of approaches to develop cooperative law enforcement programs with other countries. For example, our Legal Attache Program works closely with a large number of foreign police forces. Not only do they cooperate on specific cases, but our Legal Attaches -- who are highly-skilled senior FBI Agents -- also form a sort of distant early warning system to alert us to new and emerging crime threats. Another very powerful tool is training: the FBI places a high priority on assisting our foreign law enforcement counterparts through training courses here and abroad. And just a year ago, we took a major cooperative step with other Federal agencies and other foreign nations with the creation of the International Law Enforcement Academy in Budapest. These and other programs combine to help give the FBI the critical foundation needed to effectively combat international crime. There is also another vital factor: I want to thank this Committee for its crucial recognition of the importance of these issues and for your support in meeting the crime challenges from abroad. This is a rare opportunity to extend the Rule of Law while mobilizing law enforcement to meet the explosion of international crime against America. I am exceedingly grateful for the support Congress has given us and pledge to continue to work with Congress as we develop a stronger global network of effective law enforcement. Your support of law enforcement training at the Department of State has been critical to the success of our programs. The International Crime Problem
The political, social, and economic changes occurring in Eastern Europe and in the former Soviet Republics have provided significant, unintended opportunities for organized crime groups and criminal enterprises in these countries to expand internationally. Evidence that organized crime activity from these areas is expanding and will continue to expand to the United States is well-documented. These criminal enterprises are not a new phenomenon to Russia. They existed under Communism. Appropriate legal tools were not created to control organized crime and corruption activities. When Communism declined in the Soviet Union, the organized crime groups quickly expanded their influence in the emerging move toward Capitalism, again because sufficient constraints and law enforcement tools were not present. The FBI has many years of successful investigative and prosecutorial experience in the battle with La Cosa Nostra and other organized crime groups here in the United States. We view organized crime as a continuing criminal conspiracy having a firm organizational structure, a conspiracy fed by fear and corruption. This definition can also be applied to the organized crime threat facing Russia and many other countries. Members of a typical Russian organized crime group are found at every level of society. Organized crime activity in Russia includes monetary speculation, manipulation of the banking system, and embezzlement of state property, as well as contract murder, extortion, drug trafficking, prostitution, protection rackets, and infiltration of legitimate business activity. To make matters worse, a number of Russian/Eurasian organized crime groups and criminal enterprises presently operate in the U.S. Many of these criminal enterprises active in the U.S. have demonstrated a willingness to work in close concert with other non-Russian/non-Eurasian organized crime groups. The United States and Russia fully realize the need for joint cooperation against crimes that harm both countries -- and other parts of the world as well. That is the reason the FBI has opened a Legal Attache Office in Moscow to work closely with Russian police against a variety of costly crimes. From July 1994 to the present, the number of cases worked by the FBI Agents in Moscow has increased from 20 to over 200. If Congress agrees, and with the cooperation of the Department of State and the Department of Justice, we hope to expand our network of Legal Attache Offices around the world. The global needs are great -- and many nations, including Russia, are working diligently to fight crime that hurts the law-abiding everywhere. One of the specific issues of great concern to the FBI and to Russian authorities is the theft and diversion of nuclear materials -- and the potential theft of nuclear weapons by terrorists or rogue nations. Over the past year, legitimate concerns have been raised by the apparent vulnerability of radioactive materials to theft or diversion in several areas of Eastern Europe and Eurasia. The seizure of significant amounts of cesium in Lithuania and the seizure of uranium in the Czech Republic are examples of the concerns in the international community regarding the threat of nuclear proliferation. The recent increases in radiological-nuclear material incidents throughout the world have caused the international law enforcement community to communicate better with each other. Although there have been no seizures of nuclear material in the United States, two recent cases involved conspiracies to import radioactive material into this country. In New York, the U.S. Customs Service arrested foreign nationals attempting to negotiate the sale of radioactive zirconium metal into the U.S. Ultimately, 45 tons of the material were seized in Cyprus, enroute to the U.S. In the other case, the Canadian Customs Service intercepted radioactive isotopes originating in Russia being smuggled into the U.S. through Canada. The FBI assisted the Canadian law enforcement agencies in their investigation. While some crime problems flow from East to West, others flow back from West to East. One of the most difficult law enforcement problems facing many of the newly-freed and Eastern European nations is drug trafficking. The scourge of drug trafficking has had a devastating impact on the entire global community. Russia, the Newly Independent States and Eastern Europe are certainly not immune to this epidemic. Criminal organizations in these emerging democracies are taking advantage of the relaxed borders and improved telecommunications systems that have emerged in recent years to facilitate their illegitimate operations. These countries are targets of opportunity for the major drug trafficking organizations, like the Colombian cartels, which seek to establish new and lucrative markets. International Training
The FBI's international approach in combating Russian and other international organized crime groups includes general and specialized law enforcement training for foreign law enforcement agencies. During Fiscal Year (FY) 1995, the FBI trained 4,400 foreign law enforcement personnel. This training is particularly critical with respect to the police agencies of some of the newly-emerging democracies. Most of this training is accomplished by funding generously made available by Congress to the Department of State through the Freedom Support Act (FSA) and Support for Eastern European Democracies (SEED) funding. The FBI and the Department of State, working together, are also responsible for the International Law Enforcement Training Academy in Budapest, which functions as the center for law enforcement training for officers from many Eastern European, Russian and Eurasian nations. The Academy at Budapest provides an eight-week professional development program similar to our FBI National Academy Program at Quantico. During FY 1995, a total of three classes graduated from the Budapest Academy -- each of 33 mid- level police officers. Those officers came from the Czech Republic, Hungary, Latvia, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Estonia, and Lithuania. For FY 1996, the schedule is much more aggressive, calling for approximately 200 persons to be trained from the following countries: Albania, Belarus, Bulgaria, Croatia, Estonia, Hungary, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Latvia, Macedonia, Moldova, Poland, Russia, Slovenia, and Ukraine. We can be immensely proud of the Academy at Budapest. It is a direct outgrowth of our trip to Eastern Europe in 1994 and President Clinton's direction to U.S. Government agencies to join together to build the world's capabilities in fighting international crime. The Academy represents the combined efforts of the Department of State (DOS), the Department of Justice (DOJ), the FBI, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), the United States Secret Service (USSS), the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center (FLETC), the Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms (ATF), and other agencies and countries. It is truly a case where all of these law enforcement agencies are working together as partners toward a common goal. I cannot speak highly enough about the contributions ATF, DEA, Secret Service, IRS and the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center in the Department of Treasury have made in making the Academy succeed. The Academy brings together seasoned investigators as instructors and law enforcement officers from across Eastern Europe, Russia, and the Newly Independent States to learn policing under the Rule of Law. I am especially grateful to our host country, Hungary. Just last week, I along with my other counterparts from the United States were honored to attend the dedication of the International Law Enforcement Academy. With the recent completion of renovations, the capacity of the Academy has been expanded. The dedication was an historic moment in international law enforcement. The FBI also is involved in foreign police training in many other valuable ways. For example, in FY 1995, the FBI performed a total of 10 In-Country Training Needs Assessments. It works this way: at the invitation of the host government, we analyze that country's police training needs and capabilities. We then make a recommendation of how we believe we can best assist the host country's law enforcement capabilities through specifically targeted training. The assessments were conducted in Albania, Belarus, Bulgaria, Estonia, India, Kazakhstan, Kyrgystan, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova, Paraguay, Peru, Poland, Romania, Tunisia, Ukraine, and Uruguay. Through the FBI's In-Country Training Program, the FBI conducts one and two-week schools in foreign nations which concentrate on police operations and technical skills. We use seasoned, senior FBI street Agent instructors who use their extensive practical experience in training our foreign counterparts in policing under the Rule of Law. The instructors in these programs have an established expertise in criminal investigations, especially organized crime and white collar crime. Their credibility is not only essential for effective instruction but also is very effective in building the cop-to-cop bridges that we so critically need. Since the first of the year, we have trained 212 officers of the Ministry of Interior for the Russian Federation (MVD) in seminars held in Russia and at the FBI Academy in Quantico. Along with the instruction geared to the investigation of crimes, we have provided training in ethics and internal police controls -- the first time that this has ever been done and an area which is critical to the success of policing under the Rule of Law. Our In-Country Training Programs are primarily funded through the FSA and SEED funds we receive from the Department of State. The FBI, along with other law enforcement agencies, submit proposed international training plans to the Department of State at the beginning of the Fiscal Year. Depending on the funding that is available for law enforcement training, the Department of State then determines the funding amounts for each agency. During the past two years, the FBI has received $8.3 million of these funds for our training initiative. We have been very pleased with the support we have received from the Department of State -- all the training we have proposed has been funded. In addition, the FBI has used $300,000 of its appropriated funding to provide limited training to law enforcement in other countries. In FY 1995, the FBI provided FSA and SEED supported training seminars to over 1,800 law enforcement officers from Hungary, Poland, Slovakia, Czech Republic, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Ukraine, Russia, Romania, and Moldova. In FY 1996, we will expand our training into Belarus, Slovenia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgystan, Bulgaria, and Albania. The training provided is tailored to meet the needs of the participants. Topics addressed include bank robbery, drug trafficking, kidnapping, financial crimes, white-collar crime, organized crime and terrorism. Just recently, for example, we conducted a white-collar crime and corruption seminar in Kazakhstan. All of this training has a direct impact on United States persons and corporations who have flocked to these countries in search of business opportunities. In addition to the training funded by the FSA and SEED Acts, the FBI trained an additional 2,600 students through our other programs. These programs included the crime-specific investigative seminars, targeted crime scene analysis training as provided by our forensic experts, and management training for mid-level and executive law enforcement officers. Last year, 110 international officers also participated in the FBI National Academy program at Quantico. Their participation allows an additional "bridge" to be built from our state and local officers to those overseas. One beneficial part of this training is the opportunity it provides the trainers and the trainees to interact about specific crime problems being encountered in their countries, how to address the problem, share experiences learned in the process and forge new relationships for future cooperation on matters of mutual interest and concern. In some of our investigations, the FBI has benefitted by bringing actual case investigators to the U.S. from other nations to work side by side with FBI Agents. This is a continuation of the training we have provided and allows "hands-on" application and observation of investigative techniques successfully employed by the FBI in our organized crime investigations. As examples of the successes the FBI has seen from contacts and liaison established as a result of this training, a Central European working group on international organized crime and a six-nation working group on international organized crime were established this past year. In addition to the FBI, they bring together law enforcement agencies from Eastern and Western Europe and Canada to discuss specific organized crime threats common to all countries represented. Lines of communication and working relationships are now established and practical law enforcement approaches to the organized crime problems of the regions are planned. As a direct result of this initiative, several countries were, for the first time, able to establish continuing liaison communications with other represented organizations on a direct professional level and to initiate joint investigations. For example, a multi-national, case-specific fraud seminar was conducted by the FBI's Financial Crimes Section from February 18-22, 1996, in Berlin, Germany. The program dealt with bank failures and brought together investigators from the United States, Latvia, Netherlands, Russia, and Germany for a practical case training initiative. The resulting product of these constructive meetings is an investigative organized crime task force, international in scope, that is targeting significant criminal organizations determined to be a major threat to many nations, including the United States. The FBI also presented a nuclear non-proliferation conference at the FBI complex at Quantico, Virginia from April 18-21, 1995, and twenty-eight (28) SEED and FSA nations sent representatives, including, among others, Russia and Ukraine. The conference outlined the problems of nuclear materials and weapons proliferation from the countries of the former Soviet Union and counter-proliferation proposals and training initiatives. The conference is included as a FSA initiative to address this serious problem. The Department of Defense and the FBI are currently in the final stages of submitting the DOD/FBI Counterproliferation Program report to Congress regarding plans to provide international training seminars on nuclear smuggling. This is part of our Nunn-Lugar funded international training seminars program on nuclear smuggling. The FBI's Nuclear Biological Chemical Proliferation Unit is presently in possession of a report compiled by an FBI team that recently conducted a training assessment in the Czech Republic. During this assessment, which was coordinated by our Legal Attache in Vienna, the FBI representatives from the International Coordination Unit, the FBI Laboratory and the Engineering Section, met with various Czech law enforcement agencies, Czech nuclear safety officials, and faculty members of the Rez Institute. This assessment yielded valuable information regarding the concerns and needs of the attending Czech officials. It is proposed that the information provided by the Czechs, with regard to their specific requirements, will result in establishing a training prototype for other countries requesting support in counterproliferation matters. Interagency Working Group
As this Committee is fully aware, the Congress established the Interagency Working Group (IWG) to make recommendations as to training and other support received by Russia, the Newly Independent States, and other Eastern European countries. This has been a successful endeavor that greatly assists us in the proper coordination of our training efforts abroad. The IWG allows all Federal law enforcement agencies to participate in Department of State FSA and SEED funded training initiatives within the former Soviet Union and Bloc nations, based on their respective law enforcement jurisdiction. Participation in the IWG prevents duplication and waste of resources. IWG priorities are formulated by the Departments of State, Justice and the Treasury, as dictated by the various law enforcement entities from those departments, participating on the IWG. The FBI participates as a member of the IWG in carrying out the programs under the auspices of the FSA and SEED. Let me describe the FBI's role: The FBI, as the agency with the broadest Federal law enforcement responsibility, conducted a major portion of the training and technical assistance during FY 1995, with a similar schedule planned for FY 1996. The FBI has exclusive training in the area of organized crime. Other participating agencies like the Drug Enforcement Administration and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms, likewise have exclusive areas of training based on their expertise and jurisdiction. In other areas, such as economic crimes, training by the United States Secret Service, U.S. Customs Service, FINCEN, and DEA compliments that done by the FBI. Legal Attache Program
The FBI's Legal Attache Program is the single most significant factor in the Bureau's ability to detect, deter, and investigate international crimes in which the United States or our citizens are the victims. By stationing Agents abroad and establishing operational links with foreign police, the FBI substantially expands the nation's perimeter of law enforcement protection. Generously funded out of the Commerce, State, and Justice Bill, the FBI's Legal Attaches are truly our first line of defense. International crime has grown enormously in recent years. Technological advances and the end of the Cold War prompted dramatic increases in global travel and telecommunications. Criminals have used these changes to their advantage, diffusing their operations around the world to avoid law enforcement scrutiny. The relentless globalization of crime threatens America both at home and abroad -- and all other law-abiding nations as well. For better or for worse, the global village is now a late-20th century reality. Our experience shows that placing FBI Agents at critical posts abroad provides the most reliable, effective and timely means to combat international crime -- and often at the source. It is essential to station highly-skilled agents in other countries to prevent foreign terrorism and foreign crime from reaching the United States. At present, the FBI has in place in our Legal Attache Offices 70 senior Agents and 54 support personnel in 23 nations around the world, funded out of FBI operational funds. During FY 1995, these offices handled over 11,200 matters. They are the conduit through which law enforcement information and cooperation flows between the United States and its foreign partners. Their goal can be defined succinctly: to keep foreign crime as far from American shores as possible, to keep foreign crime permanently at bay whenever possible, to help combat more effectively those crimes that do reach our borders. The whole point is to protect the American people from harm. FBI Agents stationed overseas are not intelligence officers; they are not a shadow intelligence agency; and they do not engage in espionage. They are law enforcement Agents-- dedicated to fighting organized crime, terrorism, nuclear smuggling, violent crime, drug trafficking, and economic crime. Let me give a few examples of the direct benefits made possible because our agents are overseas and have the cop-to-cop relationships with host authorities critical to effective law enforcement. For over 15 years, FBI Agents in Rome have had a close working relationship with all the major Italian police services. Through one joint investigation which began in 1991, it was determined that members of the Sicilian Mafia, Camorra, and 'Ndrangheta were collaborating with the Colombian drug cartels in shipments of cocaine to Italy and heroin into New York. In that investigation -- which utilized sophisticated investigative techniques, including electronic surveillance -- the FBI worked closely with the Italian police services, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, and Colombian judicial authorities. As a result of our combined efforts, 89 people were arrested in the United States, Italy, Canada, and Colombia. Since their arrests, 30 of these people have been convicted in the United States alone. Kobi Mowatt, a fugitive from the United States, was recently arrested in Tanzania with assistance from our FBI Legal Attaches. Mowatt, an alleged member of the notoriously violent "First and Kennedy Street Crew," from Washington, D.C., is charged with conspiring to participate in a racketeering organization by committing acts of murder, robbery, kidnapping, and drug dealing. He was charged in a 53-count indictment with participating in four homicides, including a triple murder here in Washington in 1994. With direct assistance from our Legal Attaches, and the considerable assistance of foreign police agencies, the FBI was able to track Mowatt through Russia until his capture in Tanzania. Last month, he was brought back to the United States to stand trial. In a major move against a growing Russian organized crime structure in the United States, the FBI last year arrested Vyacheslav Kirillovich Ivankov, allegedly one of the most powerful Russian crime leaders in this country, along with five of his associates on Federal charges of conspiracy to commit extortion. The arrests in New York followed an intensive FBI investigation that was aided greatly by the Russian Ministry of Interior and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and made possible because of our Legal Attaches and the relationships that have flowed from cooperation abroad. The arrest was based upon Federal arrest warrants which charge a total of nine individuals. According to Russian law enforcement authorities, Ivankov formed a substantial criminal organization in Russia before he entered the United States allegedly to manage and control Russian organized crime activities in this country. Russian organized crime groups use businesses in the former Soviet Union, Western and Central Europe, and the United States to serve as fronts for laundering the proceeds of illegal activities and for conducting highly profitable commerce in goods in the successor states of the Soviet Union, known as the Commonwealth of Independent States. In November 1994, several of the defendants allegedly began to extort several million dollars from American and Russian businesses. Intelligence information was shared on a continuing basis among the FBI, the Russian MVD and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. FBI Legat participation was critical. Last August, Eyad Ismail was apprehended abroad and brought back to New York to face an indictment charging him with taking part in the terrorist bombing of the World Trade Center that killed six people and injured over 1,000. As the complaint alleged, Ismail fled the United States the night of the bombing. He was taken into custody after an extensive investigation greatly facilitated by an FBI Legal Attache. Last April, Ramzi Yousef and Abdul Hakim Murad were indicted in New York for a conspiracy and attempt to bomb United States commercial airlines serving air routes in the Far East. The indictment alleges that as part of the conspiracy, Yousef placed a bomb in a foreign airliner that exploded and killed one passenger. Yousef was already facing charges relating to the bombing of the World Trade Center in New York. With critical assistance from FBI Legal Attaches, Yousef was tracked to Pakistan, apprehended, and extradited to the United States to stand trial. Murad was identified and likewise extradited to the United States. Both await trial. Most recently, four Russians were charged in New York for conspiring to defraud 24 Russian companies, including a charity established to aid the victims of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster, of approximately $10.8 million. Many other important cases have been made possible only because the FBI Legal Attaches are able to freely work with our foreign counterparts toward the mutually-shared goal of effective law enforcement under the Rule of Law. The FBI is deeply grateful to Congress for the support and contributions for our Legal Attache Program. A relatively few Agents beyond our borders make a contribution out of proportion to their small numbers and the modest amount of dollars spent. As part of the FY 1996 Appropriations process, our Appropriations Subcommittees have asked us to prepare a plan reflecting our assessment of both the short and long-term Legal Attache expansion needs. We have been working closely with the Departments of Justice and State to provide Congress with a carefully thought-out plan designed to better meet the challenges we face from exploding international crime and terrorism. This plan -- which is under final administrative review -- is a realistic, down-to-earth assessment of the vast changes that have occurred in recent years in the world, especially in Europe with the breakup of the former Soviet Union. I am most grateful to our House and Senate Committees for their leadership. Quite candidly, Congress has taken planning for FBI Legal Attache Offices out of the choppy one-year cycle and prompted us to develop a long-term, comprehensive response to a rapidly changing and worsening international crime situation. Once completed, I am looking forward to discussing the plan with Congress. I am extraordinarily grateful for the support Congress has given these programs. In my view, this represents capitalizing on a rare opportunity to protect our citizens by being both prepared and sufficiently aggressive as crime moves into the global arena. At the same time, I wish to thank the Department of State and Secretary Christopher for supporting the FBI's foreign police training efforts and for their leadership on the IWG. Since my trip to Moscow and Eastern Europe in 1994 we have had an ongoing and productive dialogue about our training initiatives -- indeed, an extraordinary partnership has formed. In addition to Secretary Christopher, Deputy Secretary Strobe Talbott, former Assistant Secretary Richard Holbrooke, Ambassador Robert Gelbard, U.S. Ambassador to Hungary Donald Blinken, and many others -- both here and abroad -- have been instrumental in promoting these programs.

GLOBAL ORGANIZED CRIME

Conference Director Diane C. Snyder GLOBAL ORGANIZED CRIME Mora Stephens January 6, 1996 I pledge that the following paper represents my ideas in accordance with the university Honor Code. ____________________________
GLOBAL ORGANIZED CRIME AS A THREAT TO NATIONAL SECURITY
Global Organized Crime in the Post-Cold War Era
Since the end of the Cold War and the subsequent refocusing of Intelligence away from the Soviet Union, Global Organized Crime has been recognized as a priority threat to national security. Global Organized Crime has been defined by FBI Director Louis J. Freeh as "a continuing criminal conspiracy having a firm organizational structure, a conspiracy fed by fear and corruption." The international crimes that extend over foreign borders and into the United States include drug trafficking, extortion, money laundering, arms smuggling, bribery, and fraud schemes. In recent years these criminal groups have dramatically increased the scope of their activities by taking advantage of many Post-Cold War opportunities such as the lowering of economic and political barriers; the end of communist regimes and the founding of fragile new democracies; the increase in legitimate international trade; and the advances in technology that facilitate global communication and transport. The Administration, Intelligence and Law Enforcement have reacted to the new organized crime groups, emerging on a global scale after the Cold War, by creating a strong national response. The current system is not "broken." However, the threat itself is growing in terms of its scale and complexity at a such a fast rate that it is important to look at possible ways in which the national response to Global Organized Crime can be improved. In order to understand the significance of improving current policy and national efforts against Global Organized Crime, the changing nature and seriousness of the threat must first be understood. The Changing Threats
Emerging threats vs. Familiar problems
Global Organized Crime in the Post-Cold War Era pose some familiar national security threats and some threats that United States did not previously have to address. The security concerns that existed during the Cold War include: political instability of foreign governments, international drug trafficking and arms transfers to hostile parties. Global criminal leaders present new puzzles within these familiar threats. Former Director of the CIA, R. James Woolsey, described the difficulties of applying traditional national security methods when addressing Global Organized Crime, ...the tools of diplomacy are ineffective and irrelevant in dealing directly with these criminal groups. Even under the most difficult, intractable period of the Cold War, if consensus was not possible, communication was, nevertheless, feasible. Not so in the world of organized crime. Although we do negotiate with our key allies and friends to better attack the problem, there is no negotiating table where we can try to work out a compromise or reach a consensus with criminals.... In addition, certain distinctions can be made between Global Organized Crime and terrorism. While many terrorist groups that engage in violent acts are motivated by specific political causes, such as Egyptian Islamic Fundamentalist terrorists who use violent means to protest their country's current government and Western influences, most organized crime groups are only interested in political power for the security it would provide their organization and are primary motived by money. The international economic threat, posed by Global Organized Crime, in an increasingly global economy is among the major "new" threats to national security. The major economic powers and the less developed nations did not previously share a collective problem of this nature. Global Organized Crime does not just affect a select group of financial institutions or regional areas, it affects international financial networks and economies at a national level. These threats present new conflicts that will require innovative strategies in the future. Global Cooperation among Organized Crime Groups Cooperation among Global Organized Crime groups has increased as restrictions have lessened between international borders. These foreign havens for criminals and their assets have made it increasingly difficult for Law Enforcement to trace illegal profits; gather evidence on the criminal leaders; and identify and contain criminal groups. When Law Enforcement activities in Florida reduced the amount of Colombian cocaine being smuggled into the U.S. through the Carribean islands, the Colombian drug cartel leaders simply began working with their Mexican counterparts instead of their Carribean partners. Another example of an international partnership is Columbian drug lords selling methamphetamine to American dealers in the U.S., the ingredients for which were produced through Colombian connections to organized crime in Europe, Asia and the Far East. These global networks allow organized crime groups to greatly increase the profits of their operations and their methods of evading local governments as they share information, skills, costs, market access and relative strengths. Threat to Global Economy
Transnational organized crime groups pose more of a threat to international financial markets as the world economy becomes increasingly interdependent. Laundering billions of dollars in organized crime money worsens national debt problems because the large sums of money are then lost as tax revenue to that country's government. Russian organized crime groups are actively involved in banking, according to FBI official James Moody, because public financial institutions are "the most vulnerable and lucrative target." The Russian Interior Ministry has estimated that organized crime "controls" most of Russia's 200 banks and half of its financial capital ("control" ranges from ownership and operation to influence over bank decisions through threats of violence). U.S. and Western businesses in Russia, in particular, are frequent targets of extortion, robberies, threats and murder. Security costs for these businesses (especially physical protection, extra protection of cargo, and forced payments to gangsters for "protection,") often consume more than 30% of profits. The fear generated combined with organized crime monopolies in certain industries, such as the agriculture and construction markets in Columbia and Venezuela, damages the overall economy because it discourages legitimate, innovative businesses and entrepreneurs (foreign and domestic) from entering the market. Political Impact
Global Organized Crime can have a damaging effect on political structures, especially the fragile new systems of government found in the former communist or totalitarian regimes. South American drug cartels have a destabilizing effect on governments through their financial support of local guerilla rebels, such as the Sendero Luminoso in Peru and the Revolutionary Armed Forces in Columbia, who share their animosity toward the government and who exchange protection for money and arms supplies. The Sicilian Mafia have used their economic power over local businesses and banks and their supplies of cash to corrupt politicians, judges and Law Enforcement, assassinating many of those public figures who will not cooperate. Media polls indicate that the many Russians believe the "mafiya" is more powerful than the government. As people feel that the government is powerless to stop organized crime, they turn to crime leaders for protection and political institutions begin to deteriorate. Fear of organized crime undermines the credibility of political reform and may encourage support for anti-democratic, hardline politicians such as Russia's Vladimir Zhirinovsky who promised during the 1993 campaign to end organized crime in 3 months through mass arrest and execution. The Potential for a Major Nuclear/Arms Theat The global networks of criminals, terrorists and corrupt government officials and their complex methods of smuggling goods could easily be transferred to the smuggling of nuclear materials on a massive scale. While Global Organized Crime has become increasingly more involved in the transfer of arms, encouraged in part by conflicts in the Balkans and former Soviet Union which proved to be profitable for the Russian and Italian mafia, the smuggling of nuclear materials seems to be currently isolated to select incidents and mostly to amateurs. Russia no longer has the nuclear materials protection that it had during the Cold War when materials were controlled by a tight, centralized system under a politically powerful government. In the past year, the FBI has seized major shipments of nuclear materials in Eastern Europe, including large seizures of cesium in Lithuania and uranium in the Czech Republic. As Global Organized Crime groups become more powerful and as nuclear materials become more vulnerable (through poor management, underpaid desperate workers in the nuclear facilities, and government corruption) the threat becomes more serious. Damage to Society caused by International Drug Trafficking International drug trafficking poses a threat to the social fabric of all countries. The increase in the scale of these operations has led to an increase in drug use, addiction, and general crime level. The common U.S.-Mexico border alone causes a tremendous increase in the American drug problem: 60-70% of cocaine in the U.S. enters at this border through a Mexican-Columbian organized crime partnership. Other European organized crime groups use this border to transport heroin, marijuana, and methamphetamine. It is becoming increasingly difficult to track the flow of narcotics into the United States as the drug cartel methods become more technically sophisticated: redesigning the interiors of Boeing 727s to hold maximum amounts of cocaine; transferring drug profits electronically to dozens of banks around the world in less than 24 hours; and using falsified export documents and invoices for goods in order to disguise drug trafficking transactions. THE CURRENT NATIONAL RESPONSE TO GLOBAL ORGANIZED CRIME
The Administration
President Clinton and the current administration have acknowledged the threat of Global Organized Crime by supporting new anti-crime legislation and by highlighting the issue in public forums. Reducing transnational crime, according to President Clinton, is a part of the challenge of "making sure America remains the strongest force in the world for peace and freedom, security and prosperity" as it enters the 21st century. Presidential Decision Directive-42 (PDD-42), created by President Clinton, recognizes that Global Organized Crime is a threat to national security. The directive orders government agencies to "use creatively and aggressively all legal means to combat international organized crime,"creates the authority to deny visas to a broad range of organized criminals, and sanctions authority against governments that cooperate with or provide sanctuary to organized crime figures. While PDD- 42 brought public attention to the issue of international organized crime, it did not expand or change current policy. President Clinton merely highlighted the topic with PDD-42 and repeated older policy. In comparison, PDD-35 may prove to have a significant effect on the threat because it will affect the amount of Intelligence resources devoted to global crime. PDD- 35, which defines intelligence requirements, declares that intelligence collection and analysis of international criminal and drug activities should be a high priority. The President has also actively supported the International Crime Control Act of 1996 which addresses Global Organized Crime with measures that include expanding the definitions of money laundering, eliminating the statute of limitations for all federal criminal offenses committed outside of the United States and encourages global cooperation among governments through joint-law enforcement programs. The Act will provide U.S. Law Enforcement with a little more flexibility overseas in their investigations and arrests of international criminals. It is possible for the President to lead a government-wide initiative against a new security threat. In the late 1940's, the U.S. developed a strategy for containing Soviet sponsored communism. This unified plan of action included the Marshall Plan, military build-up, development of long-standing alliances (especially NATO), public diplomacy efforts to rebuild foreign democracies and the focusing of the Intelligence Community on the problem. The Post-Cold War Era has a different world context, but the successful strategy can still serve as a model for intergovernmental cooperation. Law Enforcement and Intelligence
Different Perspectives on Global Organized Crime
Containing organized crime traditionally has been the domain of law enforcement agencies while addressing national security concerns has been primarily the field of the Intelligence Community. Transnational crime blurs the line between "domestic" and "foreign" affairs because the criminals have a global impact: they are based in foreign countries, but have international ties, including many in the United States. The Law Enforcement perspective on Global Organized Crime is that it is a major cause in the increasing domestic and international crime levels. Law Enforcement seeks to reduce global crime through arrests and successful prosecutions of the international organized crime leaders. The Intelligence perspective examines global crime in terms of its political and economic impact overseas and as a threat to national security. Intelligence agencies pursue information on Global Organized Crime that will assist Law Enforcement in their investigations but are primarily concerned with providing policy-makers with global crime intelligence. The differing perspectives on Global Organized Crime reveals larger differences between Law Enforcement and Intelligence. Since the Law Enforcement mission is to enforce the law and provide information to court trials that will establish proof beyond a reasonable doubt, they are acutely sensitive to evidentiary requirements when collecting information. Intelligence agencies, because of their mission to provide policy-makers with relevant national security intelligence, collect information for their own analysis and are more concerned with preserving their sources than placing them under the public scrutiny of trials. Generations of Law Enforcement and Intelligence officials working for different missions have resulted in a mutual distrust of working together; while Intelligence worries about protecting its sources and methods when assisting a criminal investigation, Law Enforcement is concerned about protecting their evidence. The Law Enforcement Approach
The Department of Justice seeks to reduce Global Organized Crime by presenting a strong Law Enforcement presence overseas. In recent years, FBI Legal Attache offices alone have grown to 70 Senior Agents in 23 countries. The Legal Attache program works closely with foreign police on specific cases and acts as a "distant early warning system" to alert the FBI of emerging crime threats. Director Freeh has focused on "building cop-to-cop bridges between American law enforcement and our overseas counterparts" and views this as being the most effective means of fighting international crime. The FBI programs in the U.S. and overseas that train foreign law enforcement officers are a central element of this partnership. The model for global cooperation through training is the recent creation of the International Law Enforcement Academy in Budapest. Although the FBI has been successful in building an increasingly extensive network of police force partnerships, the Law Enforcement approach to Global Organized Crime does have its limitations. Director Freeh has suggested that "such international law enforcement problems are not solved by merely an intelligence community response. It is not a matter of spy- counterspy. Instead, it requires a law enforcement response..." Despite Director Freeh's persuasive arguments, there are certain obstacles for a law enforcement response. Collecting evidence beyond a reasonable doubt in Global Organized Crime cases is more difficult because the international networks allow criminals to hide their tracks in different bank accounts, partners, and storage areas around the world. The overall effectiveness of prosecuting these criminals is also questionable in cases when a crime leader is brought to trial, and his organization simply promotes a different criminal to that position in order to continue with its operations. The Intelligence Approach
As part of its new role addressing non-traditional threats of the Post-Cold War Era, Intelligence makes contributions of Global Organized Crime information to Law Enforcement and policy-makers. Former DCI John Deutch redirected the Intelligence Community's resources and activities toward assisting Law Enforcement to "identify, target and apprehend" criminals engaged in illegal trafficking and smuggling. The CIA has reorganized the Director of Central Intelligence's Counter-Narcotics Center into the DCI Crime and Narcotics Center. The new center has tried to provide greater opportunities for law enforcement agencies to gain "actionable intelligence" on specific global crime groups. According to David Carey, Director of the DCI Crime and Narcotics Center, intelligence collection has been primarily directed at the structure of international crime networks and the political and economic impact of the threat. HUMINT (Human-Source Intelligence) has proven to be the most effective Intelligence discipline in collecting information on global crime. In SIRs prepared at the request of the DCI and under the auspices of the National Intelligence Council, HUMINT was graded as being critically more important for narcotics intelligence than all other intelligence disciplines put together. The global networks of organized crime groups interacting with other criminal groups, terrorists and corrupt officials, are not easily observed using the technical methods that were successfully employed for national security concerns during the Cold War. They can, however, be penetrated by human sources. Human agents, through their internal access to the criminal groups, provide information on future dangers and weaknesses of the criminal networks, and without the use of covert action, disrupt and isolate international criminal groups by allowing Intelligence to place them under intense scrutiny. Although the National Security Act of 1947 prohibits the CIA from having domestic Law Enforcement powers, the CIA continues to be involved in Global Organized Crime cases that have domestic elements. Many transnational criminals have connections to American citizens and operate parts of their organization in the United States. For example, over 200 of Russia's estimated 6000 organized crime groups operate with American counterparts in 17 U.S. cities spread out across 14 states. Reagan's Executive Order 12333 clarifies CIA statutory authority in this area by authorizing the CIA to "participate in law enforcement activities to investigate or prevent clandestine intelligence activities by foreign powers or international terrorist or narcotics activity." Cooperation with Law Enforcement allows the CIA to remain active in cases with domestic elements. The CIA, under E.O. 12333, participates in the international aspects of the global crime case and Law Enforcement then handles the domestic aspects that involve U.S. citizens or other areas of domestic involvement. Cooperation Between Intelligence and Law Enforcement Problems in coordinating overseas activities between Intelligence and Law Enforcement have resulted from the greatly increasing number of overseas Justice Department agents (especially FBI), overlapping responsibilities, lack of a clear hierarchy for coordination, different missions and concerns over the risks involved in cases. Law Enforcement agencies alone have problems with inefficient overlap and interference of cases. In April 1992, five Law Enforcement agencies had duplicating analysis of drug smuggling movement by air into Mexico. There is controversy over Law Enforcement coordinating activities with the Ambassador although it is required by law to do so (22 U.S. C. 3927). Law Enforcement expresses interest in keeping the Ambassador informed of its activities but is reluctant to involve him in prosecutorial decisions. On an inconsistent basis, Law Enforcement coordinates the recruitment of confidential informants overseas with the Chief of Station. Although the Chief of Station and Law Enforcement representative are under the authority of the Embassy, there is not a clear hierarchy or set of guide-lines for coordinating activities. Since there is not a single individual or group to organize individual activities, the FBI often acts independently of Intelligence and vice versa. Intelligence and Law Enforcement, from worker to director levels of authority, have created projects to improve coordination between the communities. A special task force is trying to clarify guidelines for cooperation between Intelligence and Law Enforcement overseas. A Joint Intelligence Community-Law Enforcement (JICLE) working group (comprised of lawyers and officials from both sides) was created in 1995 and meets on a weekly basis to help devise solutions to common problems. The recommendations of the JICLE have included Intelligence- Law Enforcement training programs that overcome mission and community culture barriers through education on the laws, regulations, and procedures that facilitate coordination. The new Transnational Threats Committee of the NSC, which includes the DCI and the Attorney General, provides the first formal opportunity for overseas coordination problems to be solved at the highest levels of authority. Global Cooperation
Law Enforcement and Intelligence have found that international cooperation is one of the most effective solutions to transnational problems. The Law Enforcement Community has made significant advances in global cooperation through delegations of American law enforcement leaders visiting foreign counterparts, cooperative criminal investigations, and training programs for foreign Law Enforcement. The Aspin-Brown Commission found that Intelligence derived great benefit from such cooperative arrangements as: exchanging requests for collection; exchanging analysts and technicians; and assisting foreign countries to acquire collection capabilities in order to share the results of future collections. While U.S. Intelligence Community might not want to pursue a thorough "spy-to-spy" method analogous to FBI Director Freeh's "cop-to-cop" approach (due to the inherent risks to sources and methods), the IC still needs to continue global cooperation efforts. In many cases, global cooperation is worth the risk because it provides access to geography, skills, contacts and information that would be otherwise unavailable. ALTERNATIVES TO CURRENT POLICY TOWARD GLOBAL ORGANIZED CRIME
Direction from the Administration
The Aspin-Brown Commission's Preparing for the 21st Century: An Appraisal of U.S. Intelligence recommends that the President by Executive Order reaffirm that global criminal activities are national security matters and require a multi-agency response. The recommendation further suggests that "a law enforcement approach is inadequate." If implemented, this recommendation would have almost zero costs and obstacles but would create little improvement on the present situation by providing no additional funds, manpower or plans for action. The President has already recognized these issues in PDD-35, PDD-42 and through his support for the International Crime Control Act of 1996. The additional Executive Order would not contribute significantly to the reform effort. Legislative Boundaries
The Aspin-Brown Commission recommends an E.O. that would clarify that intelligence agencies with collection capabilities may collect information about non-U.S. persons outside the United States at the request of Law Enforcement. The Commission does not specify if Intelligence would participate based on its own volition and if Law Enforcement could actually task Intelligence. "Tasking," as opposed to "requesting information," would imply a certain amount of Law Enforcement control over Intelligence during the case. The recommendation would basically leave the situation as it is currently but would officially recognize the legality of Intelligence agencies collecting for Law Enforcement. There is a reluctance on the part of the Intelligence Community to accept direct collection requests from law enforcement agencies. NSA and CIA refuse to be directly tasked by Law Enforcement and will only proceed with a collection request on a specific target if they first determine that there is a "foreign intelligence" purpose. This formal requirement is often a mere procedural formality because most requests are determined to be relevant to foreign intelligence. Unfortunately, the requirement can also create tension between the two communities by fostering the perception that Intelligence is unwilling to assist Law Enforcement. Instead of the President creating an E.O., the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal year 1997( IAA97) responded to the Aspin-Brown recommendation with an amendment to the National Security Act of 1947 that clarifies Intelligence assistance to Law Enforcement. Section 105A states "elements of the intelligence community may, upon the request of a United States law enforcement agency, collect information outside the United States about individuals who are not United States persons." The careful wording still implies that Intelligence will participate based on its own volition. If it had been phrased as "Law Enforcement may request that...", it would have had slightly different connotations. As it is currently written, it follows the Aspin-Brown model, and officially authorizes the current Intelligence-Law Enforcement collection procedures without trying to significantly improve them. The amendment, as it was recommended by the Commission, will provide some benefits to Law Enforcement and Intelligence cooperation and will have little costs. The CIA and NSA will benefit by collecting for Law Enforcement with less concern about their legal authorities being questioned. Law Enforcement will benefit from a probable increase in collection requests that are answered. In evading the more controversial question of collection responsibilities and overseas tasking, the Aspin-Brown recommendation and IAA97 also had fewer implementation obstacles. The House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence's IC21: Intelligence Community in the 21st Century recommend that no additional clarifications of the law be made in terms of coordination and cooperation between Law Enforcement and Intelligence. They suggested that there is already enough flexibility and a workable set of legal boundaries in the current laws and standing Executive Orders. E.O. 12333 provides reasonably flexible boundaries for Intelligence assisting Law Enforcement in international criminal cases. Despite these arguments a clarification of the law, as the Aspin-Brown Commission recommended and IAA97 created, still provided some benefits. Lack of precise legal authorities can hamper, delay or side-track cooperation and communication efforts between the two communities. Coordination between Law Enforcement and Intelligence
Global Crime Committee The Aspin-Brown Commission, HPSCI and the Council on Foreign Relations reports agree that the Intelligence and the Law Enforcement Communities need a better mechanism for finding solutions to disagreements and for forming cohesive strategies. The Aspin-Brown Commission recommends that the President create by Executive Order a Global Crime Committee of the National Security Council to direct the U.S. actions against transnational security threats. The committee would be chaired by the National Security Advisor and the core members would include the Director of Central Intelligence, the Attorney General, and the Secretaries of State and Defense. Unfortunately, the Secretary of Treasury is not included among the core members even though his input would be important when the Committee discussed such transnational threats as financial crimes and illegal smuggling. The new committee would identify specific transnational groups that require a coordinated response; establish an overall strategy and monitor its implementation; develop improved procedures for sharing relevant information between the two communities; and develop guidelines to govern the coordination of law enforcement overseas. The recommendation for the creation of this committee is the one of the most significant efforts by the intelligence reform reports to improve the national strategy toward Global Organized Crime. Instead of the President using an Executive Order, Congress responded to the Aspin- Brown Commission's recommendation by creating the Committee on Transnational Threats, under section 804 of the Intelligence Authorization Act of FY 1997. With the exception of the committee's name and a few minor differences, the new Committee follows the model created by the Commission in their recommendation. Unlike the Transnational Threats Committee, previous Intelligence and Law Enforcement working groups, task forces and meetings were not held at a director level, and were not focused on forming a national strategy but rather on resolving individual conflicts between the communities. The Aspin-Brown recommendation succeeded in convincing the Congressional committees to create the Transnational Threat Committee but the real obstacle remains insuring that the directors actually use this opportunity to forge better cooperation instead of a superficial collaboration. The major cost of the committee is pulling already busy leaders away from other activities. The potential benefits of improving the national approach toward global crime will outweigh the costs. The Committee, as it was modeled after the Commission's recommendation, blends all international criminal threats into one label of "global crime" or "transnational threats." While some of the security and diplomacy issues are similar, Global Organized Crime and terrorist groups have different organizational networks, agendas, and weaknesses. They also pose different economic and political threats. While the Transnational Threats Committee will address both of these issues, it should be aware that strategies that are responsive to the differences in Global Organized Crime and terrorism will be more effective in reducing each threat. Single Law Enforcement Representative The Aspin-Brown Commission recommends that the President designate the Attorney General as the focal point and spokesperson for formulating the Law Enforcement strategy for global crime, facilitating cooperation with Intelligence and coordinating overseas Law Enforcement activities. Currently, Law Enforcement responsibility is split between the Attorney General (whose department includes FBI, DEA and INS) and the Secretary of Treasury (whose department includes Secret Service, Customs Service, and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms). The majority of Global Organized Crime issues fall under the Attorney General's responsibilities but Global Organized Crime cases that involve smuggling goods into the U.S., money laundering and other financial crimes, fall under the jurisdiction of the Secretary of Treasury. They should both be included in forming national strategies and in representing Law Enforcement as they direct departments with different responsibilities and resources. The additional Treasury perspective provides more significant benefits than the gain in efficiency that a single representative would provide. The HPSCI report similarly opposes the Attorney General acting as the single representative or the FBI acting as the lead agency of Law Enforcement. HPSCI argues that it would be a mistake to ignore overseas law enforcement agencies outside of the Justice Department. This is an important recommendation because while the FBI has provided innovative solutions to global crime and should continue to be active in influencing the improvement of the overall law enforcement strategy, it is not the only agency involved in overseas activities. Priority in the National Strategy and Coordination
Since effective coordination requires strong leadership, the Aspin-Brown Commission and the Council on Foreign Relations Report suggest that a coordinated national effort against global crime would benefit from Intelligence taking priority over Law Enforcement. According to the Aspin-Brown Commission, in order to coordinate daily activities overseas, Law Enforcement should play a subordinate role under the Ambassador and the Chief of Station. However, HPSCI argues against Intelligence taking immediate priority over Law Enforcement and only recommends that the Chief of Station and the Ambassador be "kept reasonably informed of law enforcement objectives and plans." While Intelligence agencies can make a significant contribution to policy-makers forming decisions on Global Organized Crime, they should not necessarily be given priority over Law Enforcement. The CFR's suggestion that Intelligence be given priority "lest pursuit of evidence or individuals for prosecution cause major foreign policy problems or complicate ongoing Intelligence and diplomatic activities" does not justify subordinating Law Enforcement. In many foreign countries, American Law Enforcement agents and their local activities are eagerly welcomed by the foreign governments who are concerned with stopping their national crime problems. There may be more distrust of American Intelligence. Since the majority of Law Enforcement cases are overt and carried out with the coordination of foreign police, there is little danger of Law Enforcement causing a "major foreign policy problem." RECOMMENDATIONS
Recommendations for the new Transnational Threats Committee:
1.This study recommends that the Committee include the Secretary of Treasury when addressing such issues as illegal smuggling and financial crimes. The agencies under the Department of Treasury, in addition to those under the Department of Justice, are actively involved in the national effort against transnational crime. Global crimes that fall under the Treasury jurisdiction include: narcotics and other contraband smuggling (U.S. Customs Service); counterfeiting American money (U.S. Secret Service); money laundering and financial crimes (Financial Crimes Enforcement Network). One obstacle to implementing this recommendation is the argument that inviting the Secretary of Treasury would be unnecessary because the Attorney General is already representing Law Enforcement in the Committee. While the departments under the Attorney General are also involved in these areas, there are some situations where Department of Treasury would be more affected and more importantly, the Committee and its national strategy would benefit from the Treasury perspective. 2.The Committee should set up a practical, working hierarchy overseas to conduct Intelligence and Law Enforcement activities under a coordinated policy. One of the stated functions of the Committee is to "develop guidelines" for coordination overseas but it is necessary to specify that the Committee needs to set up guidelines for a specific hierarchy, if coordination reforms are to be effective. There is already interest in both communities in improving coordination of activities overseas. But in actual practice, Law Enforcement often acts independently of Intelligence and vice versa because lines of authority overseas can become blurred. Problems with communication are due there not being a single person or group to lead and organize the individual activities. It is further recommended that the Chief of Station (COS) be in charge of the actual coordination of these activities. As the head of the Embassy, the Ambassador should be kept informed of both Intelligence and Law Enforcement activities but his personal involvement in the details of coordination should continue to depend on the individual Ambassador. The Committee should give the Chief of Station clear guidelines for organizing activities and the authority necessary to accomplish efficient coordination of resources. They should clearly define the COS and the Law Enforcement responsibilities to each other as well as to the Ambassador. The major obstacle could be opposition from the Attorney General and Law Enforcement officials (especially FBI) who are supportive of greater cooperation but who are rapidly increasing their activities overseas and do not want to see their freedom limited by the Chief of Station. Another concern is that unless the Committee sets up clear lines of authority, it may be difficult for the Chief of Station to coordinate activities and ensure that Law Enforcement adheres to the guidelines. 3.The Committee should form a separate proactive strategy for Global Organized Crime and Drug Trafficking Networks. The IC, in order to avoid wasting resources through duplication, must recognize the similarities between Global Organized Crime and other transnational threats. However, the different activities and potential vulnerabilities of Global Organized Crime must also be acknowledged by the Committee if it is to form an effective strategy against the threat. For example, an intelligence strategy for Global Organized Crime might focus on gathering information on the international money laundering networks. Since laundered money is necessary to continue the daily operations of these criminal networks, a concentrated multi- agency attack on the money laundering channels could be debilitating to Global Organized Crime groups and Drug Traffickers. While terrorist groups can also be involved in money laundering, this strategy may not be as successful in preventing terrorist attacks. From the other perspective, strategies used against terrorism may not prove to be as effective against organized crime. Implementing this recommendation would strengthen the national effort against Global Organized Crime by producing a coordinated strategy specific to its own concerns. The costs would be low because it would not necessarily entail devoting more resources to addressing the threat but rather using the existing resources more effectively. Certain Committee members may oppose the recommendation on the belief that it would be a waste of resources to devote the Committee and the agencies they represent to one transnational threat when they could take advantage of the similarities of the threats. However, the importance of having a "Transnational Threat" committee instead of having a "Global Organized Crime" committee already takes advantage of these similarities by pooling the leaders and resources involved in all of these threats. Within the Committee, the differences should also be recognized. 4.The Committee should create more liaison programs between Intelligence and Law Enforcement dealing with Global Organized Crime. The two communities are already participating in programs like this, but since the benefits are significant, the Committee should encourage cooperation and integration on a working level through more programs. On a case by case level, they would benefit from the different perspectives and on a higher level of authority, they would benefit from the joint programs because it would help to facilitate future cooperation. The cost of adding more joint projects is relatively small when compared with the benefits of cases that result in greater intelligence gathering/prosecutions and in less resources being used overall because manpower and technology have been shared between the communities. 5.This study recommends that the Committee make efforts to improve coordination with foreign governments. Global cooperation is necessary to fight criminal groups with increasingly interconnected networks around the world. FBI Director Freeh has been very successful in establishing working partnerships with foreign Law Enforcement and governments. He sees building "cop-to-cop" connections as the key to fighting global crime. Just as strengthening the coordination between domestic agencies is a necessary step toward a more effective national strategy, improving coordination between American and foreign agencies is also an important part of reducing Global Organized Crime One obstacle would be the reluctance of Intelligence to work even closer with foreign governments, their intelligence agencies and their Law Enforcement. In the case of Russia, many law enforcement officials accept bribes from organized crime and detectives are sometimes forced to not report to their superiors for fear that the suspects will be warned of raids and arrests. Intelligence may not want to work too closely with foreign intelligence agencies in order to protect their sources and methods. However, there is always an intelligence problem of trust when dealing with human sources but the successes of HUMINT demonstrate that the benefits are worth the risks. 6.This study concurs with the HUMINT and Non-proliferation conference studies' recommendation for further use of HUMINT in dealing with transnational threats. These underground networks can be penetrated by human sources. Human agents can learn the complexities and vulnerabilities of an international network of criminal individuals and groups. The expensive satellite imagery that was helpful in collecting information on large military sites during the Cold War may not be that effective in collecting information on Global Organized Crime. There are more risks involved in trusting human sources but it is more effective in dealing with Global Organized Crime and the costs are low when compared with technical collection. Recommendations for the President: 7.This study recommends that the President confer regularly with the Transnational Threats Committee while forming his national strategy on Global Organized Crime. The new Committee offers the President an incredible opportunity to combine all of the separate abilities and interests represented by the DCI, the Attorney General, the Secretaries of State and Defense, under a unified set of anti-global crime objectives. Since IAA97 also states that the President may designate additional members, he has even more opportunities to use the Committee to respond to his needs with regard to transnational threats. The major obstacle is the President's own disapproval of the creation of the Committee. In his statement on signing the Authorization Act regarding the new Committee, he wrote, "Such efforts to dictate the President's policy process unduly intrude upon Executive prerogatives and responsibilities. I would note that under my Executive authority, I have already asked the NSC to examine these issues." The combined decisions of Intelligence and Law Enforcement leaders should provide insights into creating a coordinated policy that the NSC had previously not provided. The President frequently speaks about the importance of addressing transnational threats so he should be more interested in forming an effective solution-oriented policy against them. 8.The President should support the continuation of both the Attorney General and the Secretary of Treasury acting as representatives of Law Enforcement. The President should not select the Attorney General as the single representative for Law Enforcement. The Attorney General already acts as the Law Enforcement spokesperson in many areas dealing with Global Organized Crime. In areas that pertain more to the Treasury, such as financial crimes, the Secretary should continue to be brought in as a representative. MEASURING SUCCESS OF THE REFORMED INTELLIGENCE RESPONSE TO GLOBAL ORGANIZED CRIME
9.The Transnational Threats Committee should make formal annual assessments on the effects of the changes made through the reforms described above and address the weaknesses in the implementation. Reform and improvement of coordination should be a continuous process and the Committee needs to form a systematic way to continue reform of Intelligence and Law Enforcement coordination and the national response to Global Organized Crime. Possible areas for them to examine would be if there was a more cohesive national strategy; if activities overseas were actually being coordinated under the Chief of Station or if Law Enforcement officials were acting independently; and if, as a result of the reforms, there were improvements made in the Global Organized Crime assessments given to policy-makers. The President and his staff should also make a yearly assessment of the success of the Committee. He should provide feedback on how the Committee could better respond to transnational threats and provide him with information relevant to formulating a national strategy. Actual trends in Global Organized Crime and individual cases of major crime groups should be analyzed to determine if the coordinated response formulated by the Committee had an impact on the threat.

Dr. Beare’s e-mail address is mbeare@yorku.ca. This book features the work of eleven international scholars who were asked to examine the policing and politics that surround transnational crime, organized crime, money laundering and corruption. Most countries are under pressure to respond to such criminal challenges in a uniform manner in accordance with numerous international agreements, conventions, and guidelines; but some critics are concerned about what might be described as a gradual “Americanization” of international policing practices and policies 1
. They are especially concerned about the high priority placed on proceeds of crime and money laundering. This book emphasizes the significance of transnational crimes or organized criminal activity, the impact of illegal proceeds of crime upon specific markets, and the diverse forms of corruption they create. The various articles challenge some of the current political preoccupations with these issues and attempt to compare rhetoric with more empirically-based realities. Themes and Structure of the Book The book explores a number of common themes: the exploitable nature of taking organized crime as problem; the non-empirical basis for much of the media, police, and political responses; and the unintended consequences that can result from well-intentioned enforcement initiatives. Of additional interest are the policing and security industries that have grown up to “combat” organized crime and corruption, and whose livelihoods benefit from the high priority assigned to these forms of criminality. Contributing Authors Chapter One
on “Transnational Organized Crime: The Strange Career of an American Concept” is written by Michael Woodiwiss. 2
He provides us with a historical mapping of the American roots of our current understanding of what has become known as organized crime, and traces not only the antiquity of concern over organized crime but the distortion of our current focus. Power and politics have a determining influence on the definitions of ‘organized crime’ in the present international community. Chapter Two
by Tom Naylor, 3
is entitled “Predators, Parasites, or Free-market Pioneers: Reflections on the Nature and Analysis of Profit-Driven Crime”. It asks the reader to re-examine at a more micro-level the claims that are typically made about profit-driven crimes. He establishes three classifications of profit-driven crimes: predatory crimes for profit, which involve involuntary transfers; market-based exchanges in which illegal goods or services are sold for profit; and commercial exchanges which are the illegal production or illegal distribution of otherwise legal goods or services. Each of these categories of profit-driven crime has a different impact on society, and that impact is not always negative. Hence, societal responses, particularly those of law enforcement agencies, might be wise to differentiate rather than to group together all profit-driven criminal activity under the heading of “organized crime”. Chapter Three,
“From National to Global, from Empirical to Legal: The Ambivalent Concept of Transnational Organized Crime”, is written by Valsimas Mitsilegas. 4
His chapter provides the current European interpretation of legislation in Italy, Germany, the United Kingdom, the European Union and the United Nations. He documents the vague, ill-defined national and organizational responses. His analysis outlines the emergence of the organized-crime offence at the global level, and examines anti-organized crime initiatives against a backdrop of fundamental legal principles, thereby revealing the negotiations and compromises that go into obtaining multi-jurisdictional agreements. Chapter Four, “The Business of Bribery: Globalization, Economic Liberalization, and the ‘Problem’ of Corruption”, is written by James Williams 5
and Margaret Beare, 6
and takes on the issue of transparency. The chapter examines the role of the World Bank, International Monetary Fund and other international organizations such as Transparency International in packaging the current focus on one specific form of corruption, namely that which hinders the economies of the more developed countries. The chapter traces the growing response of international communities to corruption, and argues that globalization has created new political and economic spaces that are being largely filled by initiatives that conform to an economic logic defined by the developed world. International organizations that appear to have separate voices are all reading from the same script: a script that supports global business and finance. Chapter Five
is entitled “Against Transnational Organized Crime, and is written by James Sheptycki. 7
It examines the language that has grown around the activities subsumed under “transnational organized crime”. Sheptycki describes the veil being drawn over police work as policing becomes increasingly international and takes on a new rhetoric of transnational organized crime. The police apparatus now includes security forces and elite squads operating according to diverse international standards. In this new order, traditional accountability mechanisms are no longer adequate. The hard-won advances towards visibility in domestic policing are undermined by the call for all-out war against transnational organized crime. Chapter Six
by Kyle Grayson 8
on “Discourse, Identity, and the US ‘War on Drugs’”, analyses from a Foucaultian perspective the foreign policies of the United States against drug trafficking. He examines the rhetoric of both the “war on drugs” and the “security-threat” that has succeeded in merging drugs with the traditional discourses of transnational crime. His objective in this chapter is to understand both the reasons why the United States has chosen to link drugs with security and the methods by which this linkage has been made. Chapter Seven
on ‘Global Markets and Crime”, is written by Vincenzo Ruggiero. 9
It presents case materials that illustrate the role of ‘legitimate’ professionals in facilitating many ‘transnational’ crimes. He argues that white-collar crime and organized crime are increasingly blurred within the international cross-jurisdictional criminal environment. Vincenzo Ruggiero emphasizes the close links between legitimate business and illegitimate operations and argues that forms of social control help to determine the forms that crime will take. He sees “globalization” changing social control mechanisms, in turn causing changes in criminal activity. One result is an increasingly blurred relationship between the concepts of white-collar crime and organized crime. Cases are presented that illustrate the role of corporations and other ‘legitimate’ segments of society in supporting or facilitating criminal activity. After these somewhat theoretical papers, the remaining four chapters examine more concrete law enforcement issues. In Chapter eight, “Organized Corporate Criminality: Corporate Complicity in Tobacco Smuggling”, Margaret Beare examines in detail one example of a white-collar-organized crime. The tobacco industry has been shown to have operated in identical ways to more traditional notions of organized criminals: actively engaged in smuggling, fraud, money laundering and violence. The revelations concerning the tobacco corporations lead us to question why they have avoided being labelled criminal for so long. While some of their immunity relates to the general difficulty with proving white-collar crime, other equally valid reasons relate to the power of the corporations, and the limited range of people to whom we apply the term “organized criminal” or, for that, matter apply the criminal law. Chapter Nine, “The War on Drugs and the Military: The Case of Colombia”, by Juan Gabriel Ronderos, 10
challenges the rhetoric of the “war” on drugs, and law-enforcement responses arising from the foreign policies that underlie the rhetoric. He examines the consequences of such policies and law enforcement on a country such as Colombia, and shows the unintended consequences of misdirected enforcement strategies or misguided priorities. Chapter Ten
is entitled “Drug Trafficking and Organized Crime in Canada: A Study of High-level Drug Networks” ad is written by Fred Desroches. 11
He demonstrates empirically that the popular rhetoric about so-called “high-level drug traffickers” is largely false. His study 12
is part of a growing body of empirical research suggesting that even high-level drug traffickers come in many different types and that the members of a network engage in many different working arrangements among its members. The key finding is that the majority of traffickers are individual entrepreneurs who could quit, aspire to move up in the illicit occupational chain, or change and work with the competition. His study, based on interviews with high-level drug traffickers in prisons across Canada, dispels some of the myths about these criminals and their relationship to the larger entity collectively termed “organized crime”. If these criminals are not as imagined, perhaps other unverified assumptions about organized criminal groups should be questioned. Chapter Eleven
brings the book to an end with “Follow-the-Money Methods in Crime Control Policy”, a second chapter by Tom Naylor. It was written specifically for the Nathanson Centre for the Study of Organized Crime and Corruption on discusses the inherent fallacies of enforcement strategies directed against money laundering and proceeds of crime. Naylor examines forfeiture laws and the prime international policing strategy of going after illicit money. He challenges the assumptions upon which the prioritizing of anti-money laundering initiatives is based and suggests alternative approaches.

CHINESE TRANSNATIONAL ORGANIZED CRIME: THE FUK CHING
by James O. Finckenauer, Ph.D. International Center National Institute of Justice Organizational Structure
The organizational structure of Chinese organized crime in the United States is quite complex. Broadly defined, there is a great variety of Chinese criminal organizations. These include gangs, secret societies, triads, tongs, Taiwanese organized crime groups, and strictly US-based tongs and gangs. According to Ko-lin Chin, the foremost academic expert in the U.S. on Chinese organized crime, there is no empirical support for the belief that there is a well-organized, monolithic, hierarchical criminal cartel called the ?Chinese Mafia.? Chin says: ?My findings...do not support the notion that a chain of command exists among these various crime groups or that they coordinate with one another routinely in international crimes such as heroin trafficking, money laundering, and the smuggling of aliens? (1996:123). In order to simplify and focus our discussion, this analysis will concentrate on the Fuk Ching gang. The Fuk Ching are active in New York City, and are regarded as one of the most powerful, and also transnationally active, Chinese organized crime groups in the U.S. (Chin, 1996). They are estimated to have approximately 35 members, with another 20 members currently in prison. Other major gangs in New York City include the Ghost Shadows, Flying Dragons, Tung On, and Born-to-Kill. The New York City gangs, like the Fuk Ching, mainly operate extortion and protection rackets in defined neighborhoods in New York?s Chinatown. Their victims are mostly businesses in Chinatown. In California, the Chinese organized crime presence and problem is quite different from that in New York. In California, the dominant groups are the Wo Hop To and the the Wah Ching. One of the structural characteristics that makes Chinese organized crime different from other forms is the relationship between some of the street gangs and certain adult organizations. The latter are called tongs. The Fuk Ching, for example, are affiliated with the Fukien American Association. The Fukien American Association ? as with other tongs and their relationships with gangs ? provide the Fuk Ching with a physical place to gather and hang out. They allow the gang to operate on their (the tong?s) territory, thus legitimizing them with the community. They also provide criminal opportunities (such as protecting gambling operations), as well as supplying money and guns. The Fuk Ching originally emerged in New York in the mid-1980s, and as with other gangs, their main criminal activity in Chinatown was extortion. They were founded by a collection of young men (youth in their late teens and early twenties) from Fujian province in China -- many if not all of whom had criminal records in China. Fuk Ching recruitment today continues to be among Fujianese teenagers. Tong-affiliated gangs, like the Fuk Ching, have an ah kung (grandfather) or shuk foo (uncle) who is their tong leader. The top gang position is the dai dai lo (big big brother). Communicationbetween the tong and the gang occurs principally between these two individuals. Below the dai dai lo in descending order are the dai lo(s) or big brothers, the yee lo/saam lo (clique leaders), and at the bottom the ma jai or little horses. There are a variety of norms and rules that govern the gangs. These include respecting the ah kung, beating up members of other gangs on your turf, not using drugs, following the orders of the dai lo, and not betraying the gang. Rules violators are punished, sometimes severely, such as through physical assault and killing. Violence
Our research and our interviews with various experts confirms that violence is a defining characteristic of Chinese criminal gangs. Use of violence within the group and against other organized crime groups is very prevalent. Disputes over territory and criminal markets among the gangs are typically resolved using kong so, a process of peaceful negotiation. When this does not occur, however, the resolution is usually a violent one, in which guns are used against rival gang members. Law enforcement authorities believe that an escalation of gang violence has taken place in recent years, due in part to the advent of the Fuk Ching, and to gang involvement in alien smuggling activities. Based on his research, Chin concludes the following with respect to Chinese gang violence in general: The capacity for violence appears to be one of the key defining characteristics of street gang culture. Its employment, however, is shaped and determined by a cluster of constraints related to profit-generating goals. Violence between and among gangs is regulated through an agent or ah kung who attempts to channel aggressive behavior in ways that effectively maintain gang coherence. Gang coherence in turn supports the gang?s involvement in extortion activities and in the provision of protection services to organized vice industries in the community (Chin, 1996:138). The Fuk Ching are violent, but their use of violence is not very sophisticated nor specialized. It is not the systematic use of violence (including threats) to protect and gain monopoly control of criminal markets that is associated with mature forms of organized crime. Instead it is more likely to be random street level violence, with guns, employed by anyone in the gang. Sometimes this violence is sanctioned and sometimes not. Economic Resources
Understanding alien smuggling to be the illegal movement of migrants across national borders, and human trafficking to be migrant smuggling that includes coercion and exploitation, the Fuk Ching are extensively involved in both types of activities. Indeed, these criminal activities, along with kidnapping, are the main transnational crimes of the Fuk Ching. Their dominance is related to Fujian Province being the principal source of Chinese being smuggled and trafficked into North America. On the domestic scene, their main criminal activities in New York City?s Chinatown are extortion and gambling. Each Chinese gang dominates these crimes in theirparticular Chinatown neighborhoods. This includes the Fuk Ching. The professionalism and sophistication of the Fuk Ching are quite low, again as compared to more mature forms of organized crime. The same is true of other Chinese criminal gangs operating in the United States. This may be due to their being generally much younger than, for example, LCN or Russian organized crime figures. Also, their criminal activities are not particularly sophisticated, although the Fuk Ching may be becoming more complex in their organizational structure as they become more heavily engaged in human trafficking. In his research, Chin (1996) found that Chinese gangs were quite active in legitimate businesses in New York City?s Chinatown. For example, they owned or operated restaurants, retail stores, vegetable stands, car services, ice cream parlors, fish markets, and video stores. On a higher, more professional level, they also owned or operated wholesale supply firms, factories, banks, and employment agencies. In addition, on the West Coast Chinese gangs are believed to have penetrated the entertainment industry. Perhaps it is because of their relatively small size, the youth of their members, their lack of business experience and acumen, and the geographical constraints in which they operate, that Chinese gangs such as the Fuk Ching do not seem to play significant roles in the broader legitimate economy. Political Resources
The expert consensus is that the Fuk Ching, like other Chinese gangs, do not have the connections and stature to make them capable of corrupting U.S. police and judges. There have been only one or two cases of police corruption (none in recent years), and no cases of judicial corruption. As to political influence, there is some ability to manipulate the political system via corruption in China ? namely in Fujian Province and with respect to their human trafficking enterprise. In the United States, however, there is no evidence of corrupting the political process, of getting members elected or appointed to political office, nor of being able to manage media coverage of their activities. They are influential only in Chinatown, and their connections to U.S. politicians are non-existent. Any political influence Chinese gangs have is exerted through the tongs with which they are affiliated. For example, it is reported that the head of the Fukien American Association once gave $6,500 to a New York City Mayor?s re-election campaign (Kleinknecht, 1996:168). That the affiliation is not only beneficial to the gangs is evidenced in Chin?s report that tongs and other Chinatown community organizations benefit from the Chinese gangs? threats of extortion because business owners donate money to the associations in the belief that this will buy protection (1996). There is no evidence that Chinese gangs are involved with political terrorism either abroad or at home. Nor that they are associated with armed political groups of any kind. Response of Law Enforcement
The New York City Police Department (NYPD), which polices the neighborhood in which the Fuk Ching are active, uses all the standard law enforcement practices commonly used to combat organized crime. These include informants, undercover investigators, and electronic surveillance. In addition, both the police and the FBI support and encourage extortion victims to use hot lines to report their victimization. The NYPD has also created an Asian Gang Intelligence Unit that employs street patrols to monitor street gangs. Of the 15 Chinese crime groups indicted under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) between 1985 and 1994, one involved the Fuk Ching. In that 1993 case, 20 defendants were charged with, and pled guilty to murder. The investigation was conducted jointly by the FBI and the NYPD. On the international level, U.S. law enforcement has undertaken a number of initiatives to improve international cooperation against Chinese organized crime groups. These include the creation of the International Law Enforcement Academy (ILEA) in Bangkok, Thailand, and sponsorship of numerous international meetings on Asian organized crime. Annual meetings of the International Asian Organized Crime Conference attract more than a thousand law enforcement officials from dozens of countries. Both the ILEA and the conferences promote interaction among officials of affected countries, and lead to better cooperation and better information. Ko-lin Chin concludes that many crimes in Chinese-American communities ? especially drug trafficking, money laundering, and human trafficking ? are linked to China. He says that Chinese gang members flee to China when sought by American law enforcement. He recommends that ?deportation, extradition, joint operations, and intelligence sharing among law enforcement authorities from various countries...be carried out routinely....extradition treaties...be instated....[and that] U.S. authorities...be more culturally sensitive in dealing with foreign law enforcement agencies? (Chin, 1996:187). The External Environment
There is not general cultural acceptance of Chinese gangs such as the Fuk Ching in Chinatown. Most Chinese business owners comply with gang extortion demands because compliance is easier and less risky than resistance. As previously indicated, the gang affiliation with a tong gives them a degree of acceptability in the neighborhoods associated with that particular tong. The gang must be tolerated in order to gain any benefit that accrues from the tong. It would seem that there is little need in Chinatown for awareness raising campaigns on organized crime, or for sensitizing citizens on the dangers and threats posed by Chinese gangs. The Chinese who live in these neighborhoods are fully aware and fully sensitized. Rather than public information campaigns, Chinese businessmen would prefer a tougher criminal justice system. As Chin reports, ?they [Chinese businessmen] would like to see harsher punishment for offenders, the reinstitution of the death penalty..., and the deportation of chronic Chinese criminals? (1996:98). They also want to see many more Chinese police officers in theirneighborhoods. Because of the compartmentalized nature of Chinese organized crime in the United States, the public at large is little aware of and little concerned about what is going on in Chinatowns in U.S. cities. National media pay relatively little attention to these problems. For example, an Internet search of major U.S. newspapers under the topic ?Asian organized crime? for the period January 1, 1998 - August 1, 2000 produced only 13 articles. Chinese involvement in human smuggling, however, may be the exception to this rule. Chinese human smuggling has received considerable attention. A recent conference in Washington, DC on human smuggling pointed to five possible reasons for the high public profile given Chinese smuggling operations: (1) they are expensive; (2) associated human rights abuses are considerable; (3) they are highly efficient; (4) there is an enormous potential pool of migrants; and (5) collecting intelligence and other information from China is extraordinarily difficult (Conference Report, Transatlantic Workshop on Human Smuggling, 2000). Human trafficking activities by Chinese gangs such as the Fuk Ching are contributing to this higher profile. REFERENCES

WASHINGTON (AFP) Tuesday April 26, 2005
The
Hubble
Space
Telescope
turned 15,
with
750,000 photographs of deep space
and Earth to its credit, but its future is now uncertain. Hubble
was launched by the
Space
Shuttle Discovery on April 25, 1990, and opened a new era in astronomy. However, the
telescope, a cooperative effort of NASA and the
European Space
Agency, would not be operational until three years later. [The Hubble Space Telescope]

Enlarge The Hubble Space Telescope
A mirror that had been improperly ground was corrected in 1993, when a new camera was also installed in the
first repair mission by a space
shuttle. Once repaired, the
telescope
beamed back photographs 10 times sharper than ever before of galaxies, supernovas, giant explosions marking the
death of a star and the
birth of a black hole. Thanks to Hubble, flying above the
atmospheric distortion that hinders even more powerful Earth-based telescopes, scientists have been able to confirm that the
universe is rapidly expanding and to calculate precisely its age, at 13.7 billion years, according to NASA. Among other achievements, Hubble's observations allowed scientists to confirm the
existence of a strange form of energy called dark energy; proved the
existence of super-massive black holes; provided sharp views of a comet hitting Jupiter; and showed that the
process of forming planetary systems is common throughout the
galaxy, NASA said in a statement. NASA has so far decided not to send a shuttle to repair the
aging Hubble, citing the
450 million dollars it would cost to do so. But the
space
agency's new chief, Michael Griffin, has said he would revisit the
decision. Astronauts have serviced Hubble
four times, and many scientists hoped that a fifth service mission would be funded to enable Hubble
to function to 2011, when its infrared replacement, the
James Webb Space
Telescope, is scheduled to arrive. Currently, it is believed that Hubble's aging solar cells will provide enough energy to survive to 2007.   Hubble Space Telescope turns 15, with a galaxy of achievements

White House Cuts Hubble Servicing Mission from 2006 Budget Request Astronomers Surprised by White House Plan to Scuttle Hubble The Fight Begins Once Again for Hubble's Life By Leonard David
Senior Space Writer posted: 24 January 2005 06:44 am ET
space
A White House decision to cut funding for a Hubble Space Telescope servicing mission and dump the observatory into a remote stretch of ocean waters at a future date is sure to incite debate in scientific, engineering, and policy making circles. Intensive work has been underway at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center to develop telerobotic servicing skills for the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) in the event that a space shuttle crew is never again sent to the orbiting facility. Aerospace firms in the United States and in Canada have teamed with NASA to develop a Hubble Robotic Vehicle Deorbit Module. Either a robotic or shuttle-based servicing option reportedly would cost in excess of $1 billion. That pricetag is viewed by the White House, according to sources, as not affordable given other high-priority and more expensive efforts, such as the return-to-flight of the space shuttle program, as well as moving forward on NASA’s Moon, Mars and beyond agenda. White House plans to scuttle Hubble is part of NASA’s 2006 budget request, sources said, with some money in the budget allocated to using a propulsion module coupled to Hubble for its safe but destructive deorbiting. The cutting of the HST servicing mission from NASA’s 2006 budget request was first reported

on its website Friday and on  SPACE.com
. Leading the fight Senator Barbara Mikulski (D-Md.), a fervent Hubble supporter whose state is home to both the Goddard Space Flight Center and the Space Telescope Science Institute, issued a statement late January 21 in which she vowed to continue advocating an HST servicing mission. "It is essential that we have a safe and reliable servicing mission to Hubble," Mikulski said, that is consistent with the findings of the Columbia Accident Investigation Board and last month’s findings of a National Academy of Sciences (NAS) panel on the Hubble issue. On December 8, in the NAS final report released by the Committee on the Assessment of Options for Extending the Life of the Hubble Space Telescope, a blue ribbon group of experts said that NASA should reinstate a space shuttle mission to refurbish the Earth-orbiting telescope. "I led the fight to add $300 million to NASA’s budget last year for a Hubble servicing mission, and I plan to lead the fight again this year. This is what the American people expect and deserve," Mikulski said in a statement.  In defense of Hubble Response to the White House decision has engendered a wait-and-see attitude in some astronomical quarters, while others have been quick to react. Hubble’s best days lie ahead, predicted John Bahcall, a professor of natural sciences at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey. In 1998, he was a recipient of the National Medal of Science for his pioneering efforts in neutrino astrophysics and his contributions to the development and planning of the Hubble Space Telescope. "President Nixon cancelled in 1973 the Hubble Telescope while it was still in the development phase. The reason was similar: other activities in the NASA budget took priority," Bahcall told SPACE.com. "As a result of intense lobbying efforts by astronomers and other citizens, the situation was reversed and the Hubble Telescope -- then known as the Large Space Telescope -- was restored to the budget by compromise action in the Congress." Bahcall said that Hubble has contributed enormously to scientific knowledge and to America’s respect abroad. The telescope represents achievements of which all Americans can be proud, he said. "I am confident that Americans of all walks of life will come to the defense of the Hubble and cause the Congress to restore the repair of the telescope to the NASA budget," Bahcall said. Telerobotic progress Excellent progress is being made on a telerobotic approach to servicing the Hubble, said Jim Crocker, vice president of civil space at Lockheed Martin Space Systems of Denver. The firm has supported NASA’s planning and then repair and servicing of the HST via four space shuttle missions to date. The telerobotics team at work at Goddard Space Flight Center "have a good shot at pulling this off," Crocker told SPACE.com
the day before the Space News
story on the White House HST decision appeared. Lockheed Martin’s role in the rocket-launched Hubble Robotic Vehicle Deorbit Module (HRVDM), Crocker said, is providing all the sensors to do the rendezvous and docking with the Hubble, as well as provide the liquid-fueled propellant module that would later deorbit the telescope. For their part, Canada’s MacDonald, Dettwiler and Associates (MDA) Ltd. -- through its MD Robotics group in Brampton, Ontario -- is providing the Dextre robot that’s part of the HRVDM. It is being specially configured to replace batteries, gyroscopes, and perhaps an instrument on the HST to extend its life. NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center is overseeing and integrating the HRVDM work. Crocker said that simulations performed at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight center have converted doubters, including him, that performing many of the scheduled Hubble servicing tasks through the tender loving care of telerobotics is feasible. "That’s not to say it’s not challenging," Crocker said, "but the team is making a convincing story." Rabbit out of the hat There’s also good news to report in keeping Hubble in an operating mode. Worry centers on HST’s gyroscopes, batteries, or other gear that might fail early, negating the observatory’s useful lifetime. "The team continues to pull rabbits out of the hat," Crocker said. For instance, a two gyro science mode, along with the needed software has been worked out. HST’s original design had to have three gyros working to do science. Additionally, a new battery management approach is being adopted. "That’s good news," Crocker said. "I’m hearing we’re likely to be able to get [HST] into 2008 now." At the end of the day, Crocker concluded, whatever option is decided upon for Hubble servicing and its ultimate reentry, "everyone on the team wants the best chance of success possible."    Sponsored Links

TREC-8 Interactive Track Guidelines
TREC-8 Interactive Track Guidelines Goal  ----  The high-level goal of the Interactive Track in TREC-8 remains the investigation of searching as an interactive task by examining the process as well as the outcome. To this end a experimental framework has been designed with the following common features:         - an interactive search task         - 6 topics         - a document collection to be searched         - a required set of searcher (demographics) questionnaires         - 6 classes of data to be collected at each site and submitted to NIST         - 3 summary measures to be calculated by NIST for use by participants The framework will allow groups to estimate the effect of their experimental manipulation free and clear of the main (additive) effects of participant and topic and it will reduce the effect of interactions. In TREC-8 the emphasis will be on each group's exploration of different approaches to supporting the common searcher task and understanding the reasons for the results they get. No formal coordination of hypotheses or comparison of systems across sites is planned for TREC-8, but groups are encouraged to seek out and exploit synergies. As a first step, groups are strongly encouraged to make the focus of their planned investigations known to other track participants as soon as possible, preferably via the track listserv at trec-int@ohsu.edu.  Contact track chair Bill Hersh
to join. General Description  -------------------  A minimum of 12 participating searchers, one experimental system, and one control system per site will be required.  The control system can be any IR system appropriate to the goals of the local experiment, e.g. a variant of the local experimental system, some other baseline system such as SMART, ZPRISE, etc.  (See "2. Augmentation" in the detailed experimental design for information about how to use more than eight searchers or more than one experimental system within this design.) Each searcher will perform six searches on the Financial Times of London 1991-1994 collection (part of the TREC-8 adhoc collection), using six topics especially chosen from the TREC-8 adhoc topics and modified for use in the interactive track.  Each searcher will perform half of the total number of searches on the site's experimental system and the other half on its control system.  The experimental design (see below) determines the order in which each searcher performs the query and uses the systems (experimental and control). In resolving experimental design questions not covered here (e.g., scheduling of tutorials and searches, etc.), participating sites should try to minimize the differences between the conditions under which a given searcher uses the control and those under which s/he uses the experimental system. For example, running all the control searches for a participant on one day and the searches on the experimental system on another invites unequal, confounding conditions. Topics ------ Each of the topics will describe a need for information of a particular type. Contained within the documents of the collection to be searched will be multiple distinct examples or instances of the needed information. The interactive topics will be modified versions of specially selected adhoc topics. Here is an example TREC-6 adhoc topic:         Number: 303          Title: Hubble Telescope Achievements          Description:          Identify positive accomplishments of the Hubble telescope          since it was launched in 1991.         Narrative:          Documents are relevant that show the Hubble telescope has          produced new data, better quality data than previously          available, data that has increased human knowledge of the          universe, or data that has led to disproving previously          existing theories or hypotheses.  Documents limited to the          shortcomings of the telescope would be irrelevant.  Details          of repairs or modifications to the telescope without          reference to positive achievements would not be relevant. Here is an example of the same topic as it would be modified for use in the TREC-8 interactive track. Note the addition of the "Please save" paragraph and the removal of the usual Narrative section with its specific criteria for relevance or non-relevance:         Number: 303i          Title: Hubble Telescope Achievements          Description:          Identify positive accomplishments of the Hubble telescope          since it was launched in 1991.         Instances:         In the time alloted, please find as many DIFFERENT positive          accomplishments of the sort described above as you can.         Please save at least one document for EACH such DIFFERENT          accomplishment.         If one document discusses several such accomplishments, then          you need not save other documents that repeat those, since your          goal is to identify as many DIFFERENT accomplishments of the sort          described above as possible. Here are the topics for TREC-8 in NUMERICAL order. See the section "Experimental design for a site" below for their assignment to blocks and the order of presentation within the experimental design. Number: 408i Title: tropical storms Description: What tropical storms (hurricanes and typhoons) have caused property damage and/or loss of life? Instances: In the time alloted, please find as many DIFFERENT storms of the sort described above as you can. Please save at least one document for EACH such DIFFERENT storm. If one document discusses several such storms, then you need not save other documents that repeat those, since your goal is to identify as many DIFFERENT storms of the sort described above as possible. Number: 414i Title: Cuba, sugar, imports Description: What countries import Cuban sugar? Instances: In the time alloted, please find as many DIFFERENT countries of the sort described above as you can. Please save at least one document for EACH such DIFFERENT country. If one document discusses several such countries, then you need not save other documents that repeat those, since your goal is to identify as many DIFFERENT countries of the sort described above as possible. Number: 428i Title: declining birth rates Description: What countries other than the US and China have or have had a declining birth rate? Instances: In the time alloted, please find as many DIFFERENT countries of the sort described above as you can. Please save at least one document for EACH such DIFFERENT country. If one document discusses several such countries, then you need not save other documents that repeat those, since your goal is to identify as many DIFFERENT countries of the sort described above as possible. Number: 431i Title: robotic technology Description: What are the latest developments in robotic technology and in its use? Instances: In the time alloted, please find as many DIFFERENT developments of the sort described above as you can. Please save at least one document for EACH such DIFFERENT development. If one document discusses several such developments, then you need not save other documents that repeat those, since your goal is to identify as many DIFFERENT developments of the sort described above as possible. Number: 438i Title: tourism, increase Description: What countries have experienced an increase in tourism? Instances: In the time alloted, please find as many DIFFERENT countries of the sort described above as you can. Please save at least one document for EACH such DIFFERENT country. If one document discusses several such countries, then you need not save other documents that repeat those, since your goal is to identify as many DIFFERENT countries of the sort described above as possible. Number: 446i Title: tourists, violence Description: In what countries have tourists been subject to acts of violence causing bodily harm or death? Instances: In the time alloted, please find as many DIFFERENT countries of the sort described above as you can. Please save at least one document for EACH such DIFFERENT country. If one document discusses several such countries, then you need not save other documents that repeat those, since your goal is to identify as many DIFFERENT countries of the sort described above as possible. Searcher task ------------- The task of the interactive searcher is to save documents, which, taken together, contain as many different instances as possible of  the type of information the topic expresses a need for - within a 20 minute time limit. Searchers will be encouraged to avoid saving documents which contribute no instances beyond those in documents already saved, but there will be no scoring penalty for saving such documents and searchers will be told that. Instructions to be given to searchers ------------------------------------- The following introductory instructions are to be given once to each searcher before the first search:         "Imagine that you have just returned from a visit to your doctor          during which it was discovered that you are suffering from high         blood pressure. The doctor suggests that you take a new experimental         drug, but you wonder what alternative treatments are currently          available.  You decide to investigate the literature on your own         to satisfy your need for information about what different          alternatives are available to you for high blood pressure treatment.         You really need only one document for each of the different          treatments for high blood pressure.          You find and save a single document that lists four treatment drugs.         Then you find and save another two documents that each discusses a         separate alternative treatment: one that discusses the use of         calcium and one that talks about regular exercise.  You've run out          of time and stop your search. In all, you have identified six          different instances of alternative treatments in three documents.          ---         In this experiment, you will face a similar task. You will be          presented with several descriptions of needed information on a          number of topics. In each case there can be multiple examples or          instances of the type of information that's needed.         We would like you to identify as many different instances as you         can of the needed information for each topic that will be presented          to you -  as many as you can in the 20 minutes you will be given          to search.  Please save one document for EACH DIFFERENT instance          of the needed information that you identify. If you save one          document that contains several instances, try not to save additional         documents that contain ONLY those instances. However, you will not          be penalized if you save documents unnecessarily.           As you identify an instance of the needed information, please keep          track of which instances you have found: write down a word or short          phrase to identify the instance, or--if the system provides a          facility to keep track of instances--use it.                  Carefully read each topic to understand the type of information          needed. This will vary from topic to topic. On one topic you may be          looking for instances of a certain kind of event. On another you may          be searching for examples of certain sorts of people, places, or          things.         Do you have any questions about          - what we mean by instances of needed information          - the way in which you are to save nonredundant documents for each           instance?" Searcher questionnaires (minimum) ----------------------- Provided by Rutgers (see track web site) Data to be collected and submitted to NIST (emailed to over@nist.gov) ------------------------------------------ Several sorts of result data will be collected for evaluation/analysis (for all searches unless otherwise specified):    ===>  Due at NIST by 30. August 1999:         1. sparse format data       ===>  Due at NIST by when the site reports for the conference are due:         2. rich format data         3. a full narrative description of one interactive session for            whichever topic is designated as T1         4. any further guidance or refinement of the task specification            given to the searchers         5. data from the common searcher questionnaires Sparse format data for each search will comprise the list of documents saved and the elapsed clock time of the search. The searcher's selection (choice) of items for the final output list must be identified in terms of each document's TREC document identifier (DOCNO). The elapsed (clock) time in seconds taken for the search, from the time the searcher first sees the topic until s/he declares the search to be finished, should be recorded.  It is assumed that the interactive search takes place in one uninterrupted session.  If a session is unavoidably interrupted, it is recommended that it be abandoned and the topic given to another searcher.  Sparse format data will be the basis for the summary evaluation at NIST, which will produce a triple for each search: instance precision, instance recall, and elapsed clock time. Rich format data for each search will record: - the word or phrase each searcher records to describe each   instance s/he identifies (no reference to the containing document(s)) - significant events in the course of the interaction and their    timing.             Rich format data are intended for analytical evaluation by the            experimenters.             All significant events and their timing in the course of the            interaction should be recorded.  The events listed below are those            that seem to be fairly generally applicable to different systems            and interactive environments; however, the list may need extending            or modifying for specific systems and so should be taken as a            suggestion rather than a requirement:           o Intermediate search formulations:  if appropriate to the              system, these should be recorded.           o Documents viewed:  "viewing" is taken to mean the searcher              seeing a title or some other brief information about a              document; these events should be recorded.           o Documents seen:  "seeing" is taken to mean the searcher              seeing the text of a document, or a substantial section of              text; these events should be recorded.            o Terms entered by the searcher:  if appropriate to the              system, these should be recorded.           o Terms seen (offered by the system):  if appropriate to the              system, these should be recorded.           o Selection/rejection:  documents or terms selected by the              user for any further stage of the search (in addition to the              final selection of documents).  Format of sparse data to be submitted to NIST --------------------------------------------- TWO files from each site            A. Search file         Here a "search" is the interaction of a searcher given a topic         and asked to carry out the interactive search task using a given          system against the collection - lasting at most 20 minutes.         One line for EACH SEARCH, each line containing the          following blank-delimited items from left to right:                 1. Unique site ID                 2. Search ID  - site's choice (links search & document files)                 3. Searcher ID - site's choice                 4. System ID - site's choice                 5. TREC topic number                                          6. Elapsed time - number of secs., fractions truncated                    Clock time from the moment the searcher sees the                     topic until the moment the searcher indicates the                     search is complete or time is up.   B. Documents file         One line for each document in a given search result,         each line containing the following blank-delimited         items from left to right:                 1. Chronological sequence number ( "1", "2") within a search                    Use number of last time saved if saved multiple times.                          2. Search ID (from search file)                 3. TREC document identifier (DOCNO)              NOTE: Reported data items listed within each line must NOT          contain whitespace.      Format of other data to be submitted to NIST -------------------------------------------- Data other than that in sparse-format should be submitted as ASCII text files. The FA-1 score plus the questionaire data for each searcher should be  submitted in a separate file with format close to the following example but with the real responses to the right of the colons. The Tutorial Worksheet and Experimenter Note need not be submitted.         S i t e:         S e a r c h e r  I D:         FA-1 score:  ?         P r e - s e a r c h :                   (1 per searcher)         Searcher:       id         Condition:      ?         Degrees:        degree major date         Degrees:        degree major date         Degrees:        degree major date         Degrees:        degree major date         Degrees:        degree major date         Occupation:     ...         Gender:         M | F         Age:            nn         Previous TREC:  Y | N         Online searching: nn         Q1:             1-5         Q2:             1-5         Q3:             1-5         Q4:             1-5         Q5:             1-5         Q6:             1-5         Q7:             1-5         Q8:             1-5         S e a r c h :                           (8 per searcher)         Searcher:       id         Condition:      ?         Topic #:        nnn         Q1:             1-5         Q2:             1-5         Q3:             1-5         Q4:             1-5         Q5:             1-5         Q6:             1-5         P o s t - s y s t e m :                 (2 per searcher)         Searcher:       id         Condition:      ?         Q1:             1-5         Q2:             1-5         Q3:             1-5         Comments:       ...         S e a r c h e r   w o r k s h e e t :   (8 per searcher)         Searcher:       id         Condition:      ?         Topic #:        nnn         1.              ...         2.              ...         3.              ...         .         .         .                  E x i t :                               (1 per searcher)         Searcher        id         Q1:             1-5         Q2:             1-5         Q3:             1-5         Q4:             one-system's-name       rank                         other-system's-name     rank         Q5:             one-system's-name       rank                         other-system's-name     rank         Q6:             one-system's-name       rank                         other-system's-name     rank         Q7:             ...         Q8:             ...         Q9:             ... Evaluation of data submitted to NIST ------------------------------------ Evaluation by NIST of the sparse format data will proceed as follows. For each topic, a pool will be formed containing the unique documents saved by at least one searcher for that topic regardless of site. For each topic, the NIST assessor, normally the topic author, will be asked  to:         - read the topic carefully          - read each of the documents from the pool for that topic and            gradually:            - create a list of instances of the topic's needed information              type found somewhere in the documents            - select and record a short phrase describing each instance found            - determine which documents contain which instances            - bracket each instance in the text of the document in which it               was found For each search (by a given participant for a given topic at a given site),  NIST will use the submitted list of selected documents and the assessor's instance-document mapping for the topic to calculate:         - the fraction of total instances (as determined by the assessor) for            the topic that are covered by the submitted documents (i.e.,            instance recall)         - the fraction of the submitted documents which contain one or more           instances (i.e., instance precision)   The third measure, elapsed clock time, will be taken directly from the  submitted results for each search. Experimental design for a site ------------------------------   1. Minimal experimental matrix as run     The design for this year's track departs from last year's.  One limitation     of last year's balanced block design was the potential statistical     confouding of topic and its order.  A design that controls for query order     leads to a simpler statistical analysis of results.     As such, this year's approach will insure that each query is searched in     each position (first through sixth) by each system.  This requires a     minimum of 12 searchers per site.  In addition, the query orders for     each site will need to be generated in a pseudorandom fashion.  To make     this process consistent, the query orders will be generated by the OHSU     group.  Below is an example of system-query order for a site.  (NOTE:     Please do not use this example, as new sets must be generated for each     12-searcher block.)                  Subject       Block #1           Block #2                      1      System 1: 6-1-2    System 2: 3-4-5                      2      System 2: 1-2-3    System 1: 4-5-6                      3      System 2: 2-3-4    System 1: 5-6-1                      4      System 2: 3-4-5    System 1: 6-1-2                      5      System 1: 4-5-6    System 2: 1-2-3                      6      System 1: 5-6-1    System 2: 2-3-4                      7      System 2: 6-1-2    System 1: 3-4-5                      8      System 1: 1-2-3    System 2: 4-5-6                      9      System 1: 2-3-4    System 2: 5-6-1                     10      System 1: 3-4-5    System 2: 6-1-2                     11      System 2: 4-5-6    System 1: 1-2-3                     12      System 2: 5-6-1    System 1: 2-3-4     Query blocks should be requested from Bill Hersh
as early as possible.   2. Augmentation      The design for a given site can be augmented in two ways:        1. Participants can be added in groups of 6 using the design           above.  Additional blocks should be requested from Bill           Hersh.        2. Systems can be added by adding additional groups of 6 users           with each new system.  Additional blocks should be requested           Bill Hersh.      Topics cannot be added/subtracted individually for each site.       All augmentations other than the two listed above, however interesting,       are outside the scope of this design. If sites plan such adjunct       experiments, they are encouraged to design them for maximal synergy       with the track design.  3. Analysis      Up to each group, but all are strongly encouraged to take advantage      of the experimental design and undertake:         1. exploratory data analysis            to examine the patterns of correlation, interaction, etc.            involving the major factors. Some example plots for the TREC-6            interactive data (recall or precision by searcher or topic)            are available on the Interactive Track web site            <> under "Interactive Track History".                     2. analysis of variance (ANOVA), where appropriate,            to estimate the separate contributions of searcher, topic and             system as a first step in understanding why the results of one             search are different from those of another Last updated: Wednesday, 20-Aug-03 07:33:34 Date created: Monday, 31-Jul-00 For information about this webpage contact Paul Over

TREC-7 Interactive Track Guidelines
TREC-7 Interactive Track Guidelines Goal ---- The high-level goal of the Interactive Track in TREC-7 remains the investigation of searching as an interactive task by examining the process as well as the outcome. To this end a experimental framework has been designed with the following common features: - an interactive search task - 8 topics - a document collection to be searched - a required set of searcher (demographics) questionnaires - a required psychometric test for all searchers - 6 classes of data to be collected at each site and submitted to NIST - 3 summary measures to be calculated by NIST for use by participants The framework will allow groups to estimate the effect of their experimental manipulation free and clear of the main (additive) effects of participant and topic and it will reduce the effect of interactions. In TREC-7 the emphasis will be on each group's exploration of different approaches to supporting the common searcher task and understanding the reasons for the results they get. No formal coordination of hypotheses or comparison of systems across sites is planned for TREC-7, but groups are encouraged to seek out and exploit synergies. As a first step, groups are strongly encouraged to make the focus of their planned investigations known to other track participants as soon as possible. General Description ------------------- A minimum of eight participating searchers, one experimental system, and one control system per site will be required. The control system can be any IR system appropriate to the goals of the local experiment, e.g. a variant of the local experimental system, some other baseline system such as SMART, ZPRISE, etc. (See "2. Augmentation" in the detailed experimental design for information about how to use more than eight searchers or more than one experimental system within this design.) Each searcher will perform eight searches on the Financial Times of London 1991-1994 collection (part of the TREC-7 adhoc collection), using eight topics especially chosen from the TREC-7 adhoc topics and modified for use in the interactive track. Each searcher will perform half of the total number of searches on the site's experimental system and the other half on its control system. The detailed experimental design (see below) determines the order in which each searcher uses the systems (experimental and control). In resolving experimental design questions not covered here (e.g., scheduling of tutorials and searches, etc.), participating sites should try to minimize the differences between the conditions under which a given searcher uses the control and those under which s/he uses the experimental system. For example, running all the control searches for a participant on one day and the searches on the experimental system on another invites unequal, confounding conditions. Topics ------ Each of the topics will describe a need for information of a particular type. Contained within the documents of the collection to be searched will be multiple distinct examples or instances of the needed information. The interactive topics will be modified versions of specially selected adhoc topics. Here is an example TREC-6 adhoc topic: Number: 303i Title: Hubble Telescope Achievements Description: Identify positive accomplishments of the Hubble telescope since it was launched in 1991. Narrative: Documents are relevant that show the Hubble telescope has produced new data, better quality data than previously available, data that has increased human knowledge of the universe, or data that has led to disproving previously existing theories or hypotheses. Documents limited to the shortcomings of the telescope would be irrelevant. Details of repairs or modifications to the telescope without reference to positive achievements would not be relevant. Here is an example of the same topic as it would be modified for use in the TREC-7 interactive track. Note the addition of the "Please save" paragraph and the removal of the usual Narrative section with its specific criteria for relevance or non-relevance: Number: 303i Title: Hubble Telescope Achievements Description: Identify positive accomplishments of the Hubble telescope since it was launched in 1991. Instances: In the time alloted, please find as many DIFFERENT positive accomplishments of the sort described above as you can. Please save at least one document for EACH such DIFFERENT accomplishment. If one document discusses several such accomplishments, then you need not save other documents that repeat those, since your goal is to identify as many DIFFERENT accomplishments of the sort described above as possible.

Searchers will be encouraged to avoid saving documents which contribute no instances beyond those in documents already saved, but there will be no scoring penalty for saving such documents and searchers will be told that. Instructions to be given to searchers ------------------------------------- The following introductory instructions are to be given once to each searcher before the first search: "Imagine that you have just returned from a visit to your doctor during which it was discovered that you are suffering from high blood pressure. The doctor suggests that you take a new experimental drug, but you wonder what alternative treatments are currently available. You decide to investigate the literature on your own to satisfy your need for information about what different alternatives are available to you for high blood pressure treatment. You really need only one document for each of the different treatments for high blood pressure. You find and save a single document that lists four treatment drugs. Then you find and save another two documents that each discusses a separate alternative treatment: one that discusses the use of calcium and one that talks about regular exercise. You've run out of time and stop your search. In all, you have identified six different instances of alternative treatments in three documents. --- In this experiment, you will face a similar task. You will be presented with several descriptions of needed information on a number of topics. In each case there can be multiple examples or instances of the type of information that's needed. We would like you to identify as many different instances as you can of the needed information for each topic that will be presented to you - as many as you can in the 15 minutes you will be given to search. Please save one document for EACH DIFFERENT instance of the needed information that you identify. If you save one document that contains several instances, try not to save additional documents that contain ONLY those instances. However, you will not be penalized if you save documents unnecessarily. As you identify an instance of the needed information, please keep track of which instances you have found: write down a word or short phrase to identify the instance, or--if the system provides a facility to keep track of instances--use it. Carefully read each topic to understand the type of information needed. This will vary from topic to topic. On one topic you may be looking for instances of a certain kind of event. On another you may be searching for examples of certain sorts of people, places, or things. Do you have any questions about - what we mean by instances of needed information - the way in which you are to save nonredundant documents for each instance?" Searcher questionnaires (minimum) ----------------------- Provided by Rutgers (see track web site) Psychometric test ----------------- - FA-1 (Controlled Associations) from ETS's "Kit of Reference Tests for Cognitive Factors" (1976 Edition) Data to be collected and submitted to NIST (emailed to over@nist.gov) ------------------------------------------ Several sorts of result data will be collected for evaluation/analysis (for all searches unless otherwise specified): ===> Due at NIST by 30. August 1998: 1. sparse format data ===> Due at NIST by end of the day (Washington,DC) on 27. October 1998: 2. rich format data 3. a full narrative description of one interactive session for whichever topic is designated as T1 4. any further guidance or refinement of the task specification given to the searchers 5. data from the common searcher questionnaires 6. results from the psychometric test (FA-1) given to all searchers Sparse format data for each search will comprise the list of documents saved and the elapsed clock time of the search. The searcher's selection (choice) of items for the final output list must be identified in terms of each document's TREC document identifier (DOCNO). The elapsed (clock) time in seconds taken for the search, from the time the searcher first sees the topic until s/he declares the search to be finished, should be recorded. It is assumed that the interactive search takes place in one uninterrupted session. If a session is unavoidably interrupted, it is recommended that it be abandoned and the topic given to another searcher. Sparse format data will be the basis for the summary evaluation at NIST, which will produce a triple for each search: instance precision, instance recall, and elapsed clock time. Rich format data for each search will record: - the word or phrase each searcher records to describe each instance s/he identifies (no reference to the containing document(s)) - significant events in the course of the interaction and their timing. Rich format data are intended for analytical evaluation by the experimenters. All significant events and their timing in the course of the interaction should be recorded. The events listed below are those that seem to be fairly generally applicable to different systems and interactive environments; however, the list may need extending or modifying for specific systems and so should be taken as a suggestion rather than a requirement: o Intermediate search formulations: if appropriate to the system, these should be recorded. o Documents viewed: "viewing" is taken to mean the searcher seeing a title or some other brief information about a document; these events should be recorded. o Documents seen: "seeing" is taken to mean the searcher seeing the text of a document, or a substantial section of text; these events should be recorded. o Terms entered by the searcher: if appropriate to the system, these should be recorded. o Terms seen (offered by the system): if appropriate to the system, these should be recorded. o Selection/rejection: documents or terms selected by the user for any further stage of the search (in addition to the final selection of documents). Format of sparse data to be submitted to NIST --------------------------------------------- TWO files from each site A. Search file Here a "search" is the interaction of a searcher given a topic and asked to carry out the interactive search task using a given system against the collection - lasting at most 20 minutes. One line for EACH SEARCH, each line containing the following blank-delimited items from left to right: 1. Unique site ID 2. Search ID - site's choice (links search & document files) 3. Searcher ID - site's choice 4. System ID - site's choice 5. TREC topic number 6. Elapsed time - number of secs., fractions truncated Clock time from the moment the searcher sees the topic until the moment the searcher indicates the search is complete or time is up. B. Documents file One line for each document in a given search result, each line containing the following blank-delimited items from left to right: 1. Chronological sequence number ( "1", "2") within a search Use number of last time saved if saved multiple times. 2. Search ID (from search file) 3. TREC document identifier (DOCNO) NOTE: Reported data items listed within each line must NOT contain whitespace. Format of other data to be submitted to NIST -------------------------------------------- Data other than that in sparse-format should be submitted as ASCII text files. The FA-1 score plus the questionaire data for each searcher should be submitted in a separate file with format close to the following example but with the real responses to the right of the colons. The Tutorial Worksheet and Experimenter Note need not be submitted. S i t e: S e a r c h e r I D: FA-1 score: ? P r e - s e a r c h : (1 per searcher) Searcher: id Condition: ?

Q8: ... Q9: ... Evaluation of data submitted to NIST ------------------------------------ Evaluation by NIST of the sparse format data will proceed as follows. For each topic, a pool will be formed containing the unique documents saved by at least one searcher for that topic regardless of site. For each topic, the NIST assessor, normally the topic author, will be asked to: - read the topic carefully - read each of the documents from the pool for that topic and gradually: - create a list of instances of the topic's needed information type found somewhere in the documents - select and record a short phrase describing each instance found - determine which documents contain which instances - bracket each instance in the text of the document in which it was found For each search (by a given participant for a given topic at a given site), NIST will use the submitted list of selected documents and the assessor's instance-document mapping for the topic to calculate: - the fraction of total instances (as determined by the assessor) for the topic that are covered by the submitted documents (i.e., instance recall) - the fraction of the submitted documents which contain one or more instances (i.e., instance precision) The third measure, elapsed clock time, will be taken directly from the submitted results for each search. Experimental design for a site ------------------------------ 1. Minimal experimental matrix as run Define two blocks of four topics each, order of presentation fixed within each block: B1 = T1 -> T2 -> T3 -> T4 365i 357i 362i 352i B2 = T5 -> T6 -> T7 -> T8 366i 392i 387i 353i Participants | System,Topic --------------+-------------------- P1 | E,B1 C,B2 P2 | C,B2 E,B1 P3 | E,B2 C,B1 P4 | C,B1 E,B2 P5 | E,B1 C,B2 P6 | C,B2 E,B1 P7 | E,B2 C,B1 P8 | C,B1 E,B2 or expanded to show the individual topics: Participants | System,Topic combinations --------------+--------------------------------------------------- P1 | E,T1 E,T2 E,T3 E,T4 C,T5 C,T6 C,T7 C,T8 P2 | C,T5 C,T6 C,T7 C,T8 E,T1 E,T2 E,T3 E,T4 P3 | E,T5 E,T6 E,T7 E,T8 C,T1 C,T2 C,T3 C,T4 P4 | C,T1 C,T2 C,T3 C,T4 E,T5 E,T6 E,T7 E,T8 P5 | E,T1 E,T2 E,T3 E,T4 C,T5 C,T6 C,T7 C,T8 P6 | C,T5 C,T6 C,T7 C,T8 E T1 E,T2 E,T3 E,T4 P7 | E,T5 E,T6 E,T7 E,T8 C,T1 C,T2 C,T3 C,T4 P8 | C,T1 C,T2 C,T3 C,T4 E,T5 E,T6 E,T7 E,T8 - E = experimental system - C = Control system - site's choice - The participants (searchers) should be numbered sequentially, 1, ..., J. J must be at least 8 (see part 4 below on how to add more) Each site will randomly assign participants to the rows of its design. The order for presentation of topics to searchers at all participating sites is defined by the above design. The assignment of actual topics to T1, T2, ... T8 will be determined by NIST in collaboration with the track shortly after the interactive topics are made available. For the purposes of analysis each 4-person-by-8-topic matrix defined above will in effect be rearranged by permuting the columns (topics) so E alternates with C as in the following: Participants | System,Topic combinations --------------+--------------------------------------------------- P1 | E,T1 C,T5 E,T2 C,T6 E,T3 C,T7 E,T4 C,T8 P2 | C,T5 E,T1 C,T6 E,T2 C,T7 E,T3 C,T8 E,T4 P3 | E,T5 C,T1 E,T6 C,T2 E,T7 C,T3 E,T8 C,T4 P4 | C,T1 E,T5 C,T2 E,T6 C,T3 E,T7 C,T4 E,T8 Note that this matrix consists of the following 2x2 subdesign: E C C E This 2x2 design is a latin square design. It has the property that the "treatment effect", here E-C, the control-adjusted response, can be estimated free and clear of the main (additive) effects of participant and topic. Here, participant and topic are treated statistically as blocking factors. This means that even in the presence of differences between participants and topics, which clearly are anticipated, the design will provide estimates of E-C that are not contaminated by these differences. However, the estimate of E-C is contaminated by the presence of an interaction between topic and participant. Therefore, we replicate the 2x2 latin square 4x4 times to get the minimal 8x8 design for each site. The contaminating effect of the topic by participant interaction is reduced by averaging the sixteen estimates of E-C that are available, one for each 2x2 latin square. This is analogous to averaging replicate measurements of a single quantity in order to reduce the measurement uncertainty. 2. Augmentation The design for a given site can be augmented in two ways: 1. Participants can be added by in groups of 4 using the design for P1-4 (above). 2. Systems can be added by repeating the 8x8 design with at least one new system. Topics cannot be added/subtracted individually for each site. All augmentations other than the two listed above, however interesting, are outside the scope of this design. If sites plan such adjunct experiments, they are encouraged to design them for maximal synergy with the track design. 3. Analysis Up to each group, but all are strongly encouraged to take advantage of the experimental design and undertake: 1. exploratory data analysis to examine the patterns of correlation, interaction, etc. involving the major factors. Some example plots for the TREC-6 interactive data (recall or precision by searcher or topic) are available on the Interactive Track web site at www-nlpir.nist.gov/~over/t7i under "Interactive Track History". 2. analysis of variance (ANOVA), where appropriate, to estimate the separate contributions of searcher, topic and system as a first step in understanding why the results of one search are different from those of another.

Hubble and the Messier objects
The Hubble Space Telescope and the Messier objects [hst.jpg]
The famous Hubble Space Telescope is certainly one of the most innovative tools of the astronomers in the 1990s decade; the present author is just now going to predict (and is convinced it deserves) that it might win the title "Photographer of the Decade" for the 1990, as Voyager 2 was nominated for the 1980. Its most spectacular results, together with an open and intelligent public relations policy of the Space Telescope Science Institute, has provided astronomers with a great flood of data and high-quality images, and an outstanding popularity, especially as all the materials get public domain two years after they were obtained. The Hubble results have revolutionized the state of knowledge in virtually any branch of astronomy -- not that every good result comes from the HST, but as these data are available publicly, they are used if ever possible; from planets, comets, and asteroids to stars, clusters, nebulae, and galaxies, every sort of objects in the sky were investigated, often obtaining most revolutionary results. Among the most outstanding achievements are observations of objects from Messier's catalog, as those are outstanding representatives of all types of Deep-Sky objects. Because not every author has made his results available to the public domain, we cannot present a comprehensive review here at the moment. But we have tried to link into our catalog some of the most interesting achievements. There's but one fact on the Hubble Telescope's optics which must be kept in mind: The Hubble telescope has a very long focal length of 190 feet (58 m), and thus a one degree field measures one full meter in the space telescope's focal plane, and one arc minute about 1.7 cm. As its detectors are very much smaller, their fields of view are actually small, so that only photos of small portions of extended objects like most of Messier's catalog can be obtained. Moreover, the Hubble Space Telescope is not only an astronomical instrument (though the telescope makes up its biggest part) but also a sophisticated spacecraft. As a spacecraft, it has proven to be very reliable, and was so well operated that the technological operations did virtually never concern the scientific program (at least up to November 1999 when it shut down itself because the fourth of 6 gyroscopes failed - only to be recovered in the third servicing mission, STS-103, in December 1999). The Hubble Space Telescope (HST) was originally projected under the name "Large Space Telescope" (LST) and then simply "Space Telescope" (ST), and developed since the 1970s. Indeed, Hubble is one of the more important in a considerably long list of orbiting telescopes, or astronomy satellites. It is the second of four in a NASA series of large orbiting observatories, observing in the visible light, together with the Compton Gamma Ray Telescope (CGRO) observing in Gamma-ray light, the Chandra X-ray Observatory (CXO), and the Spitzer Space Telescope (SST)
observing in Infrared. Here's a list of links to the Hubble observations of Messier objects we could collect with our pages: M1: Jeff Hester
and Paul Scowen
of the Arizona State University, Tempe, Arizona, have obtained gorgeous images of the Crab Nebula
with the Hubble Space Telescope. These images have been reproduced previously in Sky and Telescope
of January 1995, and have provided some new and significant insight into the internal processes of this supernova remnant. Some views of fine detail
have been extracted, which are e.g. suitable for computer screen background. On May 30, 1996, new studies
of the same authors have provided some new insight into the dynamics and changes of the Crab nebula and its pulsar. Studies of June 2000
of 1995 images reveal details of the Heart of the Crab Nebula. M4: White dwarfs

M51: Hubble photos of M51, especially of its core
("X" or "y" structure in the core of M51) have been taken before and after its repair in December 1993 by the crew of the Space Shuttle mission STS-61. The HST also recorded Supernova 1994I in M51. In 2001, new images of inner spiral arms
of M51 revealed unprecedented detail of spiral arms and dust clouds. M57: HST image of M57; Oct 98 HST image. M60: HST image of M60's center
M64: IR image of M64 central region
taken by Nicmos-3 (PR 99-10 from March 18, 1999); Optical image of M64's central region, WFPC-2 (PR 2004-04 from February 5, 2004) M77: Early HST photos of M77's core
(Oct 1990). The active nucleus
of this Seyfert II galaxy was revealed by the HST early after its refurbishment in December 1993. M80: Gorgeous image of M80
from the Hubble Heritage Project, showing various types of stars including Blue Stragglers. July 1999. M81: Cepheid variables in M81
(June 1993). M82: M82 image

M100: This grand-design spiral was among the first objects photographed after the HST refurbishment
by the crew of the Shutle mission STS-61 in December 1993. Moreover, this galaxy is the home of the first Cepheid variables discovered in the Virgo cluster of galaxies, giving a distance of 50-60 million light years, and a Hubble constant of 80+/-17. However, with the refinement of the distance scale by ESA's astrometric Hipparcos satellite, this value must be refined by about 10 percent, and current estimates for H0 are closer to 67+/-7. M104: Hubble Mosaic of the Majestic Sombrero Galaxy. M105: Central Massive Dark Object
(Jan 1997) We know of more good Hubble results concerning Messier objects. They are listed below, and we would like to get images and more information for inclusion here: M95
was a target within the key project of searching for Cepheid variables in neighboring galaxies. We are still looking for Hubble images of this galaxy though. M101: The distance of M101 has been determined as 24 million light years (27 if corrected for Hipparcos data), again with Cepheids. A HST image of M101 was in a semi-recent issue of Astronomy magazine. Also, there were older images which are not yet on SEDS, e.g. in the slide sets of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific, including more photos of M42, M77, M87, and others which still await being included here. Some Hubble images of non-Messier objects have also found their way into our service: NGC 2903

[SpaceDaily Frontpage]
SPACE WIRE Hubble Space Telescope turns 15, with a galaxy of achievements WASHINGTON (AFP) Apr 26, 2005 The Hubble Space Telescope turned 15 Monday, with 750,000 photographs of deep space and Earth to its credit, but its future is now uncertain. Hubble was launched by the Space Shuttle Discovery on April 25, 1990, and opened a new era in astronomy. However, the telescope, a cooperative effort of NASA and the European Space Agency, would not be operational until three years later. A mirror that had been improperly ground was corrected in 1993, when a new camera was also installed in the first repair mission by a space shuttle. Once repaired, the telescope beamed back photographs 10 times sharper than ever before of galaxies, supernovas, giant explosions marking the death of a star and the birth of a black hole. Thanks to Hubble, flying above the atmospheric distortion that hinders even more powerful Earth-based telescopes, scientists have been able to confirm that the universe is rapidly expanding and to calculate precisely its age, at 13.7 billion years, according to NASA. Among other achievements, Hubble's observations allowed scientists to confirm the existence of a strange form of energy called dark energy; proved the existence of super-massive black holes; provided sharp views of a comet hitting Jupiter; and showed that the process of forming planetary systems is common throughout the galaxy, NASA said in a statement. NASA has so far decided not to send a shuttle to repair the aging Hubble, citing the 450 million dollars it would cost to do so. But the space agency's new chief, Michael Griffin, has said he would revisit the decision. Astronauts have serviced Hubble four times, and many scientists hoped that a fifth service mission would be funded to enable Hubble to function to 2011, when its infrared replacement, the James Webb Space Telescope, is scheduled to arrive. Currently, it is believed that Hubble's aging solar cells will provide enough energy to survive to 2007. All rights reserved. © 2005 Agence France-Presse.

By Leonard David, SPACE.com A White House decision to cut funding for a Hubble Space Telescope servicing mission and dump the observatory into a remote stretch of ocean waters at a future date is sure to incite debate in scientific, engineering, and policy making circles. The Hubble Space Telescope snaps a view of Senegal. The telescope is in need of service, which is not in the current NASA budget.
NASA/JSC
Intensive work has been underway at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center to develop telerobotic servicing skills for the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) in the event that a space shuttle crew is never again sent to the orbiting facility. Aerospace firms in the United States and in Canada have teamed with NASA to develop a Hubble Robotic Vehicle Deorbit Module. Either a robotic or shuttle-based servicing option reportedly would cost in excess of $1 billion. That pricetag is viewed by the White House, according to sources, as not affordable given other high-priority and more expensive efforts, such as the return-to-flight of the space shuttle program, as well as moving forward on NASA's Moon, Mars and beyond agenda. White House plans to scuttle Hubble is part of NASA's 2006 budget request, sources said, with some money in the budget allocated to using a propulsion module coupled to Hubble for its safe but destructive deorbiting. The cutting of the HST servicing mission from NASA's 2006 budget request was first reported by Space News on its Web site Friday and on SPACE.com. Leading the fight
Senator Barbara Mikulski (D-Md.), a fervent Hubble supporter whose state is home to both the Goddard Space Flight Center and the Space Telescope Science Institute, issued a statement late January 21 in which she vowed to continue advocating an HST servicing mission. "It is essential that we have a safe and reliable servicing mission to Hubble," Mikulski said, that is consistent with the findings of the Columbia Accident Investigation Board and last month's findings of a National Academy of Sciences (NAS) panel on the Hubble issue. On December 8, in the NAS final report released by the Committee on the Assessment of Options for Extending the Life of the Hubble Space Telescope, a blue ribbon group of experts said that NASA should reinstate a space shuttle mission to refurbish the Earth-orbiting telescope. "I led the fight to add $300 million to NASA's budget last year for a Hubble servicing mission, and I plan to lead the fight again this year. This is what the American people expect and deserve," Mikulski said in a statement. In defense of Hubble
Response to the White House decision has engendered a wait-and-see attitude in some astronomical quarters, while others have been quick to react. Hubble's best days lie ahead, predicted John Bahcall, a professor of natural sciences at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey. In 1998, he was a recipient of the National Medal of Science for his pioneering efforts in neutrino astrophysics and his contributions to the development and planning of the Hubble Space Telescope. "President Nixon cancelled in 1973 the Hubble Telescope while it was still in the development phase. The reason was similar: other activities in the NASA budget took priority," Bahcall told SPACE.com. "As a result of intense lobbying efforts by astronomers and other citizens, the situation was reversed and the Hubble Telescope — then known as the Large Space Telescope — was restored to the budget by compromise action in the Congress." Bahcall said that Hubble has contributed enormously to scientific knowledge and to America's respect abroad. The telescope represents achievements of which all Americans can be proud, he said. "I am confident that Americans of all walks of life will come to the defense of the Hubble and cause the Congress to restore the repair of the telescope to the NASA budget," Bahcall said. Telerobotic progress
Excellent progress is being made on a telerobotic approach to servicing the Hubble, said Jim Crocker, vice president of civil space at Lockheed Martin Space Systems of Denver. The firm has supported NASA's planning and then repair and servicing of the HST via four space shuttle missions to date. The telerobotics team at work at Goddard Space Flight Center "have a good shot at pulling this off," Crocker told SPACE.com the day before the Space News story on the White House HST decision appeared. Lockheed Martin's role in the rocket-launched Hubble Robotic Vehicle Deorbit Module (HRVDM), Crocker said, is providing all the sensors to do the rendezvous and docking with the Hubble, as well as provide the liquid-fueled propellant module that would later deorbit the telescope. For their part, Canada's MacDonald, Dettwiler and Associates (MDA) Ltd. — through its MD Robotics group in Brampton, Ontario — is providing the Dextre robot that's part of the HRVDM. It is being specially configured to replace batteries, gyroscopes, and perhaps an instrument on the HST to extend its life. NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center is overseeing and integrating the HRVDM work. Crocker said that simulations performed at NASA's Goddard Space Flight center have converted doubters, including him, that performing many of the scheduled Hubble servicing tasks through the tender loving care of telerobotics is feasible. "That's not to say it's not challenging," Crocker said, "but the team is making a convincing story." Rabbit out of the hat
There's also good news to report in keeping Hubble in an operating mode. Worry centers on HST's gyroscopes, batteries, or other gear that might fail early, negating the observatory's useful lifetime. "The team continues to pull rabbits out of the hat," Crocker said. For instance, a two gyro science mode, along with the needed software has been worked out. HST's original design had to have three gyros working to do science. Additionally, a new battery management approach is being adopted. "That's good news," Crocker said. "I'm hearing we're likely to be able to get [HST] into 2008 now." At the end of the day, Crocker concluded, whatever option is decided upon for Hubble servicing and its ultimate reentry, "everyone on the team wants the best chance of success possible."

The Hubble Space Telescope
by Jim Slotta Scientist
Telescopes have come a long way since the days of Galileo! Over the years, larger and larger telescopes were constructed in order to capture the light from more and more distant stars. Still, no matter how large a lens or mirror was used, there was always a problem with any telescope located on the surface of the earth, as the earth's atmosphere tends to block or absorb some of the starlight. Because the light from distant stars is very faint to begin with, this interference from the atmosphere became a serious problem as scientists looked further and further out into space. For decades, astronomers longed for a telescope that was free from the earth's atmospheric blockade -- on the surface of the moon, perhaps, or in orbit around the earth as a satellite. In 1993, they were finally rewarded, as NASA engineers delivered the orbiting Hubble Space Telescope: (Medium, 57K)
Originally, the giant light-collecting mirror of the Hubble was slightly out of shape, which meant that the images of far-off stars were out of focus. But when space shuttle astronauts repaired this problem in December of 1993, a whole new chapter in the book of astronomy had begun. One newspaper reporter wrote: "The Hubble Space Telescope, once blurry and the butt of jokes, has been repaired, making it sharp enough to see two fireflies 10 feet apart in Tokyo from Washington DC. It is sensitive enough to detect their individual flashes." --The San Fransisco Examiner
The Hubble can look at galaxies which are very old as described in an article from Philadelphia's daily newspaper, the Philadelphia Inquirer.: "...scientists announced they had pictures of galaxies so distant that the light from them had taken billions of years to reach Hubble's cameras. The telescope was therefore seeing how the galaxies looked when they were young-it was watching the past unfold." --The Philadelphia Inquirer
(Check out the Philadelphia Inquirer article to learn all about the Hubble telescope, including some of its major successes as a scientific instrument.) Evidence Information KEYWORDS Telescope, Hubble, Light, Space, Astronomy SUBMITTER Philip Bell Additional Information METHODS The evidence combines NASA photos of the Hubble with a quote from a newspaper and an informative article about the Hubble telescope's history and various achievements. This informative article, written by a Philadelphia Inquirer reporter, contains some interesting links to other related Web sites. INSPIRATION This evidence about the Hubble Space Telescope was assembled in order to provide some information about the problems with conventional telescopes and how they have been overcome. PROJECTS How Far Does Light Go? GUIDANCE - Why does the fact that the Hubble is outside of the Earth's atmosphere make a difference in what it allows us to see? - Does the fact that the Hubble can see light from galaxies which has traveled in space for billions of years support either theory in the debate? - How far away can the Hubble see stars? What does that say about the light coming from these stars? - The article tells us that the Hubble has allowed astronomers to learn more about distant galaxies. Why does it say the Hubble was seeing the galaxies as they appeared when they were very young? - Could a telescope on the earth's surface with a really huge and precise mirror or lens detect the things the Hubble is detecting? Why or why not? COMPREHENSION TIME 5 to 20 minutes SCIENCE LEVEL Middle School and Above KIE Evidence. Copyright © 1996-7 The KIE Group.

PLANETARIUM UNVEILS NEW MURAL-SIZED IMAGES TAKEN BY HUBBLE SPACE TELESCOPE Visitors will be able to witness a spectacular event at 1 p.m. April 25 at the University of Nebraska State Museum's Mueller Planetarium when two new mural-sized images taken by NASA's Hubble Space Telescope will be unveiled to the public. The stunning photographs of spiral galaxy M51 and an eerie-looking tower of gas in the Eagle Nebula commemorate Hubble's 15 years of viewing the heavens. Lincoln Mayor Coleen Seng will unveil the images. Also presenting remarks will be: Harvey Perlman, UNL chancellor, Prem Paul, vice chancellor for research, Priscilla Grew, museum director, and Jack Dunn, planetarium coordinator. The event is open to the public. No museum admission will be charged during the unveiling and reception following. The 4-foot by 6-foot image of M51 reveals striking details of how clusters of stars are born in the galaxy's long, curving spiral arms. The 3-foot by 6-foot photograph of the Eagle Nebula shows a gaseous formation sculpted by ultraviolet light from a group of massive, hot, young stars. These views are among the largest and sharpest images ever taken by the Hubble telescope and show the awesome beauty of space. The Earth-orbiting observatory was deployed in space on April 25, 1990. Hubble orbits above Earth's murky atmosphere, which distorts light from celestial objects. During its 15 years of viewing the universe, the Hubble telescope has taken more than 700,000 snapshots of celestial objects such as galaxies, dying stars and giant gas clouds, the birthplace of stars. Additional information about the Hubble Space Telescope is available at http://hubblesite.org. The new Hubble images will remain on display in the Mueller Planetarium lobby. The planetarium is located at the University of Nebraska State Museum in Morrill Hall on the UNL campus, just south of 14th and Vine streets. Admission: $8 family, $4 adult, $2 child, free with a UNL ID. Free visitor parking in front of Morrill Hall. Museum hours are Monday through Saturday from 9:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. and Sundays and holidays 1:30 p.m. to 4:30 p.m. HUBBLE TRIVIA 2005 In its 15 years of viewing the sky, NASA's Hubble Space Telescope has taken more than 700,000 exposures and probed more than 22,000 celestial objects. The Hubble Ultra Deep Field (HUDF) is the most observed area of the sky. Hubble spent more than 500 hours viewing the HUDF, snapping more than 1,100 photographs. Hubble has whirled around Earth nearly 88,000 times, racking up 2.3 billion miles. That is like making about 400,000 round trips from New York City to Los Angeles. The telescope's observations have produced 23 terabytes of data, equal to the amount of text in 23 million novels. The Hubble data would fill two Library of Congress book collections. Each day the orbiting observatory generates enough data -- about 15 gigabytes -- to fill more than three DVDs. In Hubble's 15-year lifetime, about 3,900 astronomers from all over the world have used the telescope to probe the universe. Astronomers have published more than 4,000 scientific papers on Hubble results. HUBBLE SPACE TELESCOPE'S TOP 10 GREATEST ACHIEVEMENTS When Galileo used his homemade telescope 400 years ago to view mountains on the Moon, satellites circling Jupiter, and myriad stars in our Milky Way Galaxy, he launched a revolution that changed our view of an Earth-centered universe. The launch of NASA's Hubble Space Telescope aboard the space shuttle Discovery 15 years ago initiated another revolution in astronomy. For the first time, a large telescope that sees in visible light began orbiting above Earth's distorting atmosphere, which blurs starlight and makes images appear fuzzy. Astronomers anticipated great discoveries from Hubble. The telescope has delivered as promised and continues serving up new discoveries. Astronomers and astrophysicists using Hubble data have published more than 4,000 scientific papers, on topics from the solar system to the very distant universe. The following list highlights some of Hubble's greatest achievements. The Universe is Caught Speeding Hubble played a key role in discovering that a mysterious form of energy called dark energy is acting like a cosmic gas pedal, accelerating the universe's expansion rate. Dark energy shoves galaxies away from each other at ever-increasing speeds and works in opposition to gravity. Hubble observations of distant exploding stars called supernovas placed the most significant constraints to date on the nature of dark energy, revealing that it does appear to be a constant presence as first anticipated early last century by scientist Albert Einstein. Astronomers understand almost nothing about dark energy, even though it appears to comprise about 70 percent of the universe. Tell Us Your Age Some people hate to reveal their age, and the universe, it seems, is no different. Before Hubble was launched, astronomers had been trying for several years to pin down the universe's age. They came up with a wide age range, 10 to 20 billion years. One of Hubble's key duties was to help astronomers determine a precise age for the universe. The telescope helped astronomers accomplish that goal, narrowing the universe's age to 13 to 14 billion years old, an accuracy of about 10 percent. Astronomers made observations of Cepheid variable stars -- pulsating stars used to measure vast distances -- in the Virgo and other clusters to establish the expansion rate and the universe's age. Postcards from the Edge of Space Hubble provided astronomers with a "scrapbook" full of snapshots of the early universe. The scrapbook photographs revealed "toddler" galaxies that existed billions of years ago when the universe was young. The telescope snapped the pictures of the "deep" universe in a series of unique observations, the Hubble Deep Fields, the Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey, and the Hubble Ultra Deep Field. The observations provided the deepest view of the cosmos in visible, ultraviolet, and near-infrared light. In the most recent foray into the farthest regions of the universe, Hubble uncovered 10,000 galaxies, some of which existed 400 to 800 million years after the Big Bang. Unlike our Milky Way Galaxy, the galaxies spied in the Hubble observations take many other shapes. Some are shaped like toothpicks, others like links on a bracelet. Through these observations, astronomers can follow the evolution of the star-formation rate and witness how galaxies form. By studying galaxies at different eras, astronomers can see how galaxies change over time. Worlds Beyond Our Sun Astronomers using ground-based telescopes to hunt for planets outside our solar system, or extrasolar planets, have nabbed more than 100 alien worlds. But they needed the keen "eye" of Hubble to make the first direct measurement of the chemical makeup of an extrasolar planet's atmosphere. The telescope detected the elements sodium, hydrogen, carbon, and oxygen in the atmosphere of a Jupiter-sized planet. The unique observation demonstrates that Hubble and other telescopes can sample the chemical makeup of the atmospheres of alien worlds. Astronomers could use the same technique someday to determine whether life exists on extrasolar planets. Besides testing the atmosphere of an extrasolar planet, Hubble also made precise measurements of the masses of two distant worlds. Astronomers believe that one of those worlds is the oldest known planet. The planet, whose estimated age is 13 billion years, is more than twice as old as 4.5-billion-year-old Earth. Monster Black Holes Are Everywhere The hubs of most galaxies have a mammoth resident that loves to gobble up anything that wanders near it. This sleeping monster, Hubble observations confirmed, is a black hole with a mass millions to billions times that of our Sun. Not only are black holes everywhere, but they also have an intimate relationship with their host galaxies. Hubble observations revealed that a tight relationship exists between the masses of the central black holes and those of the galactic bulges of old stars, gas, and dust that surround them. Monstrous galaxies, for example, have titanic black holes. This close relationship may be evidence that black holes grew with their galaxies, feasting on a measured diet of gas and stars swirling around the hearts of those galaxies. The Biggest "Bangs" Since the Big Bang Imagine a powerful burst of light and other radiation that can burn away the ozone in Earth's atmosphere. Luckily, bursts of light that strong occur so far away they will not scorch our planet. These bursts of light are called gamma-ray bursts. They may represent the most powerful explosions in the universe since the Big Bang, the explosive birth of our universe. Hubble images showed that these brief flashes of radiation come from far-flung galaxies that are forming stars at enormously high rates. By pinpointing the host galaxies, Hubble also identified the sources of the "bursts": the collapse of massive stars. Quasars, the Light Fantastic Quasars have been so elusive and mysterious that the hunt to define them would have taxed even the superior analytical skills of detective Sherlock Holmes. Since their discovery in 1963, astronomers have been trying to crack the mystery of how these compact dynamos of light and other radiation, which lie at the outer reaches of the universe, produce so much energy. Quasars are no larger than our solar system but outshine galaxies of hundreds of billions of stars. These light beacons have left trails of evidence and plenty of clues, but scientists have only just begun to understand their behavior. Astronomers using Hubble tracked down the "homes" of quasars, proving that these dynamos reside in the centers of galaxies. Planet Construction Zones Peering into the gaseous clouds in the Milky Way Galaxy where stars are born, Hubble discovered that many young stars are surrounded by flattened disks of gas and dust. These disks, now known as "proplyds" (short for protoplanetary disks), are the likely birthplaces of new planetary systems. Hubble provided visual proof that pancake-shaped dust disks around young stars are common, suggesting that the building blocks for planet formation are in place. A Shattered Comet Rocks Jupiter Imagine setting off every atomic bomb on Earth all at once. Now imagine repeating such an apocalyptic explosion two dozen times in a week! Unleashing such energy would destroy Earth's surface, but the giant planet Jupiter hardly flinched when it underwent such a catastrophe in 1994. Hubble provided a ringside seat to a once-in-a-millennium event when two dozen chunks of a comet smashed into Jupiter. Hubble provided dramatic images of massive explosions that sent towering mushroom-shaped fireballs of hot gas into the Jovian sky. The doomed comet, called Shoemaker-Levy 9, had been pulled apart two years earlier by Jupiter's gravity. Each impact left temporary black sooty scars in Jupiter's planetary clouds. Going Out in a Blaze of Glory A Sun-like star's death is as colorful as maple leaves in autumn. Sun-like stars die gracefully by ejecting their outer gaseous layers into space. Eventually, the outer layers begin to glow in vibrant colors of red, blue, and green. The colorful glowing shroud is called a planetary nebula. Hubble revealed unprecedented details of this process. Ground-based images suggested that many of these objects had simple shapes, but Hubble showed that their shapes are more complex. Hubble's keen "eye" disclosed that planetary nebulas are like snowflakes: no two are alike. Turning its vision to the tattered remains of a massive star that exploded as a supernova in 1987, Hubble found three mysterious rings of material encircling the doomed star. During the years since the eruption, Hubble spied brightened spots on the middle ring caused by material ejected from the explosion slamming into it. Home

Insurance Group Names Most Dangerous Vehicles 03.16.2005
By James M. Flammang
According to the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety
(IIHS), a version of the Chevrolet Blazer
may be the most unsafe vehicle to be found on American roads. Based on the Institute's study of 1999-2002 passenger vehicles, the two-door, two-wheel-drive Blazer had the highest rate of driver deaths, in both single-vehicle and multiple-vehicle accidents. While the average annual driver death rate was 87 per million registered vehicles, the two-door Blazer averaged 308 deaths per million. Rollover accidents also topped the list of 199 vehicle models, at 251 per million. Models with the highest death rates are "mostly small cars and mid-sized SUVs," the Institute asserted. The list of vehicles with high rates also included the Mitsubishi Mirage
two-door sedan, with 209 driver deaths per million vehicles, followed by the Pontiac Firebird, subcompact Kia Rio, and first-generation Kia Sportage
with two-wheel drive. Several sport-utility vehicles showed low rates. Judged by IIHS results, the safest vehicle of all could be the Mercedes-Benz E-Class
sedan, with a driver death rate of 10 per million. Next came the Toyota 4Runner
midsize SUV, Volkswagen Passat
sedan, and Lexus RX 300
(another midsize SUV). Also on the list vehicles with low death rates was the Toyota RAV4, which is a compact sport-utility vehicle. Several of the models with high driver death rates have already ceased production, and the Blazer is being phased out of Chevrolet's lineup. Kia now markets a completely different Sportage model. General Motors responded to the IIHS report by stating that the Blazer was properly tested while in production. GM also questions "what role driver behavior, such as drunk driving and driving without a safety belt, played in these deaths." Trucks, according to a GM statement, are driven more than cars, "often on secondary roads where more rollover crashes occur." The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, which conducts crash tests and engages in safety research, is affiliated with the insurance industry.

Why Do You Hate the SUV?
Date Posted 11-01-2002 This month's topic comes courtesy of the September 16, 2002, issue of Automotive News
(with a follow-up story covering the same topic in the October 7 issue). Before getting into the meat of my discussion, I think it bears mentioning that, despite the title, Automotive News
is not a 100-percent, over-the-top, prays-to-the-gods-of-internal-combustion, pro-automotive periodical. This publication, which arrives in my mailbox every Monday morning, generally does an adequate job of presenting both sides of any given topic related to the industry in which I work. However, after reading the "Chorus of SUV critics grows louder" story in the September 16 issue, and then the "Author bases anti-SUV conclusions on statistics" article from the October 7 issue, I felt it was time to address this latest anti-SUV tirade. As someone who finds plenty wrong with the current SUV situation, as chronicled in my column last March, you SUV haters can rest easy knowing I'm never going to defend any of the hypocrites who buy an SUV when they don't need one. What I am going to defend is every American's right to buy an SUV if he wants to, whether he needs it or not.
In both of the Automotive News
stories I've referenced above a gentleman named Keith Bradsher is cited as leading the charge to educate consumers about the real dangers of SUVs. Mr. Bradsher's book, High and Mighty ? SUVs: The World's Most Dangerous Vehicles and How They Got That Way
has an interesting title, though I wonder if "High and Mighty" refers to SUVs or the liberal intelligentsia that often goes around this country trying to "protect us from ourselves for our own good." In this case, I'm inclined to believe the latter simply because Mr. Bradsher partakes of the exact same type of double-talk he claims to be fighting against. Specifically, Mr. Bradsher takes issue with how the automakers paint SUVs as safe, rugged off-road vehicles capable of providing fun and adventure to their owners, even though most of those owners will never go off-road. He thinks the poor American consumer is being duped into buying SUVs by the big, mean automakers that are only interested in making a profit off of these rolling death traps that use too much gas. According to the October 7 issue of Automotive News, Bradsher thinks automakers "manipulate automotive journalists by setting up press events for sport-utilities in exotic off-road locations when they know the vehicle won't be driven that way." It further states "this distracts reviewers from evaluating the vehicles where most people drive them." Wow, and I always thought my staff did a pretty good job of identifying how even the most capable off-road vehicles will rarely be driven off-road by the average owner. Now I learn that my entire editorial team has been carefully "manipulated" by those dastardly automakers. (Can you hear the "protecting us from ourselves" overtones yet?) Thankfully, we all have someone like Mr. Bradsher to shine the light of truth on this otherwise dark and sinister plot, right? Well, not really. When Bradsher says that SUVs use more gas than other types of vehicles, he's generally correct, although many compact, and even some midsize SUVs, can get better mileage than midsize and larger sedans. But where Bradsher clearly crosses the line into deceitful reporting is his assertions that SUVs are inherently dangerous. Indeed, the title of his book calls them "The World's Most Dangerous Vehicles." If you're hearing echoes of Ralph Nader's exuberantly alarmist Unsafe at Any Speed
book from 40 years ago, you're on the right track. To justify his branding of SUVs as the modern-day Corvair, Bradsher points to accident and injury rates that show SUVs being involved in more crashes than full-size sedans or minivans. He specifically cited this point in an interview on Fox's "The O'Reilly Factor" with Bill O'Reilly. But as anyone with basic PR training knows, you can make statistics say whatever you want them to. Saying that SUVs are more dangerous than full-size sedans simply because they are involved in more accidents is like saying people who fly on airplanes are more likely to die in an air disaster when compared to people who never fly. That statement may seem overly simplistic but, remember, people on the ground occasionally die in air disasters, too. The point is that the nature of the driver (just like the nature of people who do or don't fly) is critically important in both arguments. To put it another way, look at the type of people who drive full-size sedans and minivans. In case you don't already know, full-sedans, like the Ford Crown Victoria, Buick Regal or Toyota Avalon, tend to be driven by people over 50. And minivans tend to be driven by parents transporting children (increasingly, minivans are also being driven by people over 50 who have discovered how convenient those huge sliding doors are when it comes time to get in and out of the vehicle ? my in-laws and their Oldsmobile Silhouette being a perfect example). SUVs, on the other hand, tend to be driven by young people, and they often serve as a sort of rolling party because they can carry many bodies (like a minivan) and they have a cool image (pretty much the opposite of a minivan). Yes, lots of housewives have traded in their minivans for an SUV in recent years. But minivans accounted for just over one million in U.S. sales last year, while SUVs accounted for nearly four million. Obviously, it's not just suburban moms who buy these high-profile vehicles. So you have grandparents and parents almost exclusively driving large sedans and minivans, while over in SUV land you have plenty of young, single people carrying all their friends to and from the latest social gathering. And, lo and behold, SUVs have a higher accident rate and injury rate than large sedans and minivans. Bradsher seems to have left this minor point out of his various media interviews. I'd hate to suggest he's using deceptive tactics to make a point and sell a product (sort of like touting the off-road prowess of certain vehicles that will likely never go off-road) but, oh, what the hell, I'm gonna say it anyway. And I'll present this counter argument to Bradsher: If you take two equally skilled, competent and intelligent drivers, and put one in a Lincoln Navigator and the other in a Lincoln LS, the driver in the Navigator is less likely to suffer serious injuries from a traffic accident. Keep in mind that competent and intelligent drivers always wear their seatbelt and understand that SUVs don't handle like a sports car. Or try this one on for size: You have just been told by the Great Spirit that in the next seven days you will be involved in a serious traffic accident. You don't know where, you don't know when, and you don't know the specific nature of the crash, but it will happen. The only factor you can control is what vehicle you will be driving for the next week ? Cadillac Escalade, Honda Odyssey or Toyota Avalon. Which one do you pick, Mr. Bradsher? Keep in mind that the two vehicles you don't
pick will also be involved in the accident. If Bradsher wants to make an argument that it's easier for bad drivers to crash in an SUV than in a minivan, I might actually go along with that argument. But that doesn't make the SUV "the world's most dangerous vehicle," it simply proves what we already knew: even a large, heavy vehicle can't save lousy drivers from themselves. Another point Bradsher fails to mention is the increasingly carlike nature of SUVs. In the last two years, Ford's best-selling SUVs, the Explorer and Expedition, went from riding on a solid rear axle to utilizing an independent rear suspension. This move greatly increased the stability of both vehicles. How do we know this? Well, beyond simple logic and some instrumented testing under controlled conditions, one of our editors recently had to perform a rapid lane change maneuver in our long-term Explorer
after an accident happened right in front of him on a Los Angeles freeway. He swerved hard left and then hard right, recreating the exact driving style that had previous Ford Explorers going rubber side up. In this instance, the 2002 Explorer remained stable and composed. Once again, not bad for being one of "the world's most dangerous vehicles," huh? I'll concede Bradsher's point that most SUV owners never go off-road, and I agree with him that automakers (especially domestic automakers) have more to gain by selling high-priced, high-profit SUVs instead of lower-priced cars. But, as is usually the case, market forces are addressing these issues. Today's SUV buyers demand a more refined and stable vehicle. Foreign automakers were the first ones to offer carlike SUVs, but the domestic manufacturers are quickly catching up (with models like the redesigned Explorer and Expedition). As for vehicle emissions and gas mileage, SUVs are making rapid advances in both areas as well. Honda's new Pilot already has ULEV (ultra low emissions vehicle) certification, and it gets 17/22 miles-per-gallon in city/highway driving (numbers not far behind the minivans and full-size sedans Bradsher has such an affinity for). What Bradsher and the rest of this country's SUV haters need to realize is that the genie is out of the bottle. Fifteen years ago most Americans didn't know what an SUV was, and they certainly didn't realize the kind of people-/cargo-carrying capacity such vehicles offered. They also didn't know how reassuring it feels to sit high above the road surface. Now every American over the age of 10 has either driven or ridden in an SUV, and while most may not like the tippy handling or harsh ride over broken pavement, they love the "king of the road" sensation and versatile seating/cargo options. They also like knowing that, if they wanted to, they could scamper away from the beaten path for an off-road adventure. Unlike Mr. Frost, most will never actually take that road less traveled, but we Americans like having our options open. Once again, I want to emphasize that SUVs are not for everyone, and, like any good American, I don't support single, city-dwelling, white-collar professionals, especially ones that rarely carry more than a briefcase or purse and never go off-road, buying seven-passenger vehicles that get less than 20 mpg. However, my reasoning relates to efficiency and geopolitical circumstances (it'd be good not to further grow our dependence on imported oil). However, I'm not going to sell the public a bunch of misinformation about SUVs being inherently unsafe because, well, they aren't. I also don't appreciate all the hypocritical Hollywood "environmentalists" who claim allegiance to Mother Earth?from the cockpits of their Range Rovers, Navigators and Hummer H2s. Of course, regardless of my or Bradsher's desire to see fewer SUVs on the road, the truth is that these vehicles are not going away. They will undoubtedly continue to get even safer, more refined and more fuel-efficient, but they will never disappear from the American landscape. If that thought bothers you, well, now you know how I've felt for the past two decades about rap music. Rather ironic, actually, when you consider the growing bond between certain SUVs and rap music. But hey, at least SUVs will be getting more
refined as the years pass.

Blazer Most Dangerous Vehicle, Insurance Study Finds March 15, 2005
The Mercedes E-Class sedan is the safest car on the highway, while the least safe is the two-door Chevrolet Blazer, according to a study by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS). The institute reached its conclusions about the Mercedes, Blazer and 197 other relatively popular vehicles by studying driver death rates of 1999 to 2002 model cars and trucks from 2000 to 2003. Among four-door midsize cars, the Volkswagen Passat performed best, with an average of 16 driver deaths per million registered vehicles annually, but the Chrysler Sebring had 126 driver deaths. Among midsize sport utility vehicles with four-wheel drive, the Toyota 4Runner had 12 deaths per million registered vehicles annually, compared with 134 for the two-door Ford Explorer. The study focused on the rate of driver deaths in various types of crashes, including both single- and multiple-vehicle accidents. The overall driver death rate, for 199 models studied during the 2000-2003 calendar years, was 87 per million registered vehicles annually, the institute said. The Blazer had an average of 308 driver deaths per million. It also had the highest rate of driver deaths in rollover accidents at 251 per million. "Large cars and minivans dominate among vehicle models with very low death rates" while those with the highest fatality rates are "mostly small cars and small and midsize SUVs," the study said The Results Lowest Rates of Driver Death

Why an SUV is now the most dangerous vehicle in Iraq
Patrick Graham in Baghdad Sunday April 4, 2004 The Observer
It has become clear in the past few years that four-wheel-drive SUVs are some of the most dangerous vehicles on the road. Nowhere is this more true than in Iraq. In almost every deadly attack on foreign civilians, the victims have been in Sport Utility Vehicles, almost invariably white: the occupation car of choice. The burning wreckage in Falluja last week was unmistakable. The charred bodies of the four Americans were scattered around two white SUVs. The men - Scott Helvenston, from Florida, a producer of extreme fitness videos; Jerry Zovko from Ohio; Wesley Batalona, 48, from Hawaii; and wrestling coach Michael Teague, 38, from Tennessee - were former US special forces members now working for Blackwater, a private security firm that protects Paul Bremer, the coalition's administrator. Falluja is a centre of the anti-American resistance, where even the police don't support the Americans. US soldiers don't drive through Falluja much. When they do, they have helicopter back-up and heavy armour. 'Almost every foreigner who has been killed here is an idiot,' said one ex-Navy SEAL. Soldiers often show little sympathy for those who fail to follow the right procedure. He began listing their mistakes. To start with, they were in Falluja, in an SUV. Next, he guessed they had gone through the city before and had met no problems, but were seen leaving an American base - a routine can kill you. Later, they were followed. 'People don't realise that this is war,' he said. But last week's horrific scenes in Falluja give the wrong impression. Iraq is, in fact, a lot safer than it was last summer. There is less violence now but it is better organised, more methodical. Especially in the capital. You can tell a lot about the security situation in Baghdad by listening to the city. Last summer, there was almost constant gunfire. The city was in chaos and murders and robbery were common. Today, there are police on the streets and it is much safer. The problem is that, while the police presence reduces some kinds of crime, there is nobody in control of the city. For a careful criminal, there are no consequences. The other day, we drove by a café in which gangsters hang out. If someone wants to kill you, this is where they can go. It costs $100 to have someone shot. The killers know they will never be caught. For all the media reports about foreign deaths, life is far more dangerous for Iraqis, especially Iraqis who work for foreigners. And while three journalists have been killed in the past month, they have all been killed by the American army. And they were Arab or Iraqi. This is what Iraqis complain about when they say ' maku amin ', no security. If you anger somebody, he can kill you with impunity. A foreign newspaper bureau here recently tried to fire one of its guards for sleeping on the job. A driver quietly explained that, if the guard were fired, he would hire someone to take revenge. The guard stayed. If you can't threaten someone with a vendetta, then you have very little leverage in negotiations. As a result, the tribeless Christian community has been one of the worst hit by kidnappers. In Baghdad, we listen to bombs exploding rather than chaotic gunfire. One woke us up last week, rattling the windows, blowing in the curtains. Five Iraqis were killed. What were they driving? An SUV. ·
Two attacks on Iraqi police south of Baghdad yesterday left four dead, bringing to 350 the number of policemen killed by shooting and suicide bombings in the past year. Special report

“WHAT WOULD SATAN DRIVE?” AND OTHER UNFAIR QUESTIONS ABOUT SUVs The SUV Problem—Hating Them is Too Simplistic
Given a choice, we suspect that Satan would enjoy driving any vehicle with a Burst Into Flames feature. In any event, should today's SUV drivers be condemned to Dante's 7th circle of Hell (the one known as "Yugo")? SUV bashing has become a popular sport among some. SUVs typically get poor gas mileage, they pollute more than cars, they're more [picture of pristine mountain lake]
dangerous in crashes (both for their occupants and especially for drivers of other vehicles). All these things are true. But in some ways, it is too simplistic to say that SUVs are bad and cars are good. For instance, how many of us are driving the most fuel-efficient, least polluting vehicle available on the market? In addition, other factors—such as how far we choose to commute to work, whether or not we carpool, whether or not we combine trips for errands, whether we're still driving a 15-year-old "blue smoker"—all play a role in determining our personal "driving impact" on the environment. If environmental impact is evaluated for all drivers, SUV owners are likely to score more poorly because of the gas-mileage deficit of the typical SUV as compared to a car. Don't forget, though—some SUVs get better gas mileage than some cars. In the 2004 fuel economy guide released by the US EPA and DOE, the Toyota RAV4 had the highest fuel economy in the SUV category, getting 24 mpg, whereas the best of the large cars, the Chevrolet Malibu, got only 22 mpg. The 2004 vehicle with the worst gas mileage was a car—the Lamborghini L-147, which got only 9 mpg. What??? Is Grinning Planet giving a free pass to purchasers of 6,000-pound gas-guzzling behemoths and other SUVs? No way. Most purchasers of such vehicles don't actually NEED them, and putting status, ego, or macho-ness—or, even worse, exploitation of a tax loophole—above reduction of pollution and imported oil use does indeed deserve scorn. But even if the front part of the Line of People Whose Vehicles and Driving Habits Need Improving is predominantly SUV drivers, all of us can ask ourselves [picture of pristine mountain lake]
whether we can do more to reduce gasoline usage and pollution by purchasing a more environmentally friendly vehicle or developing greener driving habits. And now, for the REAL villains in this debate; those old stand-bys we all love to jab at: Congress and the White House. And we don't just mean the current Congress and White House. For the last dozen years, our elected leaders, in concert with our never-admit-anything-can-be-improved auto manufacturers, have squashed attempts to significantly raise fuel economy standards. This is particularly irksome when it comes to SUVs, since they are driven like cars but are not held to the same gas-mileage standards as cars. We payers-at-the-pump and breathers-of-the-air should be outraged that fuel economy standards have not risen significantly for both SUVs AND cars. It's shameful that the average vehicle today gets worse gas mileage than the average vehicle in 1980. The argument that SUVs and minivans will be unaffordable or unmanufacturable if they are made more fuel efficient is the same sort of gloom-and-doom scaremongering that manufacturers put forth in the 1970s when fuel-economy and pollution standards were first proposed. Car makers CAN apply such measures to SUVs and minivans, and they should. The Union of Concerned Scientists recently designed two SUVs that were safer and more fuel efficient than today's models—without sacrificing size or performance. (See the UCS report here)
Whether you're an anti-SUV crusader who calls them "F-U Vs" or you're an SUV owner who drives one with pride, we should be able to agree that keeping reasonable style and performance choices in the vehicle fleet and making all vehicles safer, more fuel-efficient, and less polluting are both worthwhile and compatible goals.

BRAIN FOOD It is worth noting that although the Toyota RAV4 has slightly better gasoline costs and lower carbon dioxide emissions than the Chevrolet Malibu, it gets worse ratings for emissions of carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, and hydrocarbons.   You can get Grinning Planet free via email each week

  High and Mighty: SUVs—The World's Most Dangerous Vehicles and How They Got That Way
by Keith Bradsher (Non-Fiction)   DESCRIPTION Just what is it that some people hate so much about SUVs? For Keith Bradsher, it's a number of things; but let's start with their gas-guzzling obesity, their higher pollution levels, and their poor safety ratings on the road. Bradsher is also critical of the devious way Detroit has marketed SUVs and slipped them past many of the regulations that apply to "the rest of us," and he's non-too-happy about how our politicians and regulators have let it happen. But this book is not just a rant—it uses facts to make the case. You'll have to read it for yourself to decide whether SUVs really are the world's most dangerous vehicles.

  PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENT   Hey, we don't pick the Google ads!   – GP     "Even though cars get worse gas mileage than two decades ago, they actually have become much more efficient. The problem is that the efficiency went into more power and larger, heavier vehicles, not into fuel economy. If all of the technological efficiency improvements had gone into efficiency, miles per gallon would be significantly higher than they are today." — Neal Elliott, American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy

Motorcycles Remain Most Dangerous Vehicles
While travel by motor vehicle has become steadily safer in the United States, motorcycles remain the most dangerous type of motor vehicle to drive. Motorcyclists are involved in fatal crashes at a rate of 35.0 per 100 million miles of travel compared with a rate of 1.7 per 100 million miles of travel in cars. This study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) examined the association between alcohol impairment and fatal motorcycle crashes. Over the time period 1983 to 2003, the rate of fatal motorcycle crashes among alcohol-impaired drivers declined for drivers under 40 and rose for drivers over 40. The rate of fatal motorcycle crashes among alcohol-impaired drivers was highest among 20-24 year-olds in 1983 and among 40-44 year-olds in 2003. Because older drivers involved in fatal motorcycle crashes are more likely to be alcohol-impaired than younger drivers, future efforts to reduce alcohol-impaired driving among motorcyclists should include older drivers. Additional key findings include: The percentage of fatally injured motorcycle drivers who were alcohol-impaired declined from 1983 to 2003 in all age groups except the 55-59 years old age group. In 1983, 8.2% of the fatally injured motorcycle drivers with elevated blood alcohol concentrations (BAC) were aged 40 or older; by 2003, 48.2% of such drivers were in this age group. Motorcycle drivers in fatal crashes aged 40 and older were more likely to be alcohol impaired than car drivers aged 40 and older. Overall motorcycle mortality rates per 100,000 people declined from 1.6 in 1983 to 0.9 in 1993 and then rose to 1.2 in 2003. Rates for age groups under age 30 declined over this time period, whereas rates for age groups over 40 increased. Proven Community Strategies to Prevent Alcohol-Impaired Driving Include: Sobriety checkpoints 0.08% blood alcohol concentration laws Minimum legal drinking age laws Zero tolerance laws for young or inexperienced drivers School-based approaches to reduce riding with drinking drivers Management-supported intervention training programs for alcohol servers Mass media campaigns that are carefully planned and well executed, that attain sufficient audience exposure, and that are implemented in conjunction with other ongoing prevention activities

NHTSA Announces Discretionary Cooperative Agreements For Research Under The Crash Injury Research And Engineering Network (CIREN) The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) December 8 (69 FR 71101-71118) announced discretionary Cooperative Agreement opportunities to provide funding to Level One Trauma Centers in support of the Crash Injury Research and Engineering Network (CIREN). NHTSA anticipates funding these Cooperative Agreements in annual installments for one base year plus 4 one-year option years at NHTSA's option and subject to available funding. Due to budgetary constraints and the levels of effort applicants may propose, NHTSA is uncertain as to the number of Cooperative Agreements that will be funded. However, multiple awards will be made under this announcement. These cooperative agreements will support projects to improve the prevention, treatment, and rehabilitation of motor vehicle crash injuries to reduce deaths, disabilities and human and economic costs.
DATES: Applications must be submitted to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, Office of Contracts and Procurement (NPO-220), Attention: Dianne Proctor, 400 Seventh Street, SW., Room 5301, Washington, DC 20590. All applications submitted must include a reference to NHTSA Cooperative Agreement Program Number DTNH22-05-H-01001. Only complete packages received on or before 2 p.m. e.s.t. on February 8, 2005, will be considered for award. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: General administrative and programmatic questions may be directed to Dianne Proctor, Office of Contracts and Procurement, by e-mail at Diane.Proctor@nhtsa.dot.gov

by January 10, 2005 and in the Federal Register. The objective of the Cooperative Agreements is to fund CIREN Centers to add to the scope of data and expertise available and to increase CIREN's benefits to the public. NHTSA intends to award up to ten (10) Cooperative Agreements (depending on available funding at the time of award and the levels of effort proposed by the applicants) to support the goals of this initiative. Each Cooperative Agreement recipient will be expected to identify and coordinate an effort that supports the goals outlined in CIREN System Requirements. Subject to the availability of funds, it is anticipated that NHTSA will award up to ten (10) Cooperative Agreements to support the goals of this initiative for a period of five (5) years (i.e., one base year and four one-year Option Years, if exercised). Each Grantee will be expected to coordinate an effort that supports the goals outlined in the CIREN System Requirements. NHTSA anticipates that approximately three million dollars ($3,000,000.00) in total federal funding will be available for award of up to ten (10) Cooperative Agreements under this Federal Register Notice for the base year. Funding for each of the four (4) option years for each of the Grantees will be based on the availability of funds in future fiscal years. HRSA To Update State-By-State Self Assessments Of Trauma Care Systems The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) December 13 (69 FR 72204) to collect data from the 56 States and Territories on their current trauma care systems to assess progress since the initial survey in fiscal year 2002. This information will be used to establish a national strategy to assist in future grant opportunities to the States to improve or enhance their basic systems infrastructure in trauma care delivery, as well as their collection and usage of quality trauma data. HRSA will be collaborating with partners from within HRSA's Healthcare Systems Bureau, Division of Healthcare Preparedness (DHP), Bioterrorism Hospital Preparedness Program; HRSA's Office of Rural Health Policy; and HRSA's Maternal and Child Health Bureau. In addition, HRSA will collaborate with the Office of Public Health Emergency Preparedness; the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality; the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Center for Injury Prevention and Control; the National Highway Traffic and Safety Administration's Emergency Medical Services (EMS) Division; and affiliated professional organizations through the DHP Trauma Program's National Trauma-EMS Stakeholder Group. HRSA has included national performance measures for Trauma/EMS for this project in accordance with the requirements of the "Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) of 1993" (Public Law 103-62). This Act requires the establishment of measurable goals for Federal programs that can be reported as part of the budgetary process, thus linking funding decisions with performance. CMS Announces Improved Efforts To Reduce Medicare Payment Error Rates The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) December 13 announced new steps to measure error rates in Medicare payments more accurately and comprehensively at the contractor level, and to further reduce improper payments through targeted error improvement initiatives. "We have made significant strides in how we measure the error rate in Medicare payments, and that will enable us to do even more to bring it down,” said CMS Administrator Mark B. McClellan, M.D., Ph.D. “We have much better data that will help us pinpoint problems and allow us to work with the Medicare contractors and providers to make sure claims are submitted and paid properly." In addition, independent auditors for CMS issued an unqualified opinion on the agency’s fiscal year 2004 financial statements, which are required by the Government Management Reform Act. This year’s opinion marks the sixth consecutive year that CMS has received an unqualified opinion, demonstrating CMS’ stewardship, discipline and accountability in the implementation of its fiscal responsibilities Under the new measurement process for the Medicare error rate, the net national rate for fiscal year 2004 was 9.3 percent. The enhanced information comes from the first full year of data for an expanded program run by CMS to collect more detailed and contractor-specific information to help prevent future errors. CMS also announced new initiatives to reduce the error rate by more than half to 4 percent in four years, by building on recent reforms in payment oversight and new authorities in the Medicare law. Medicare pays more than 1 billion claims each year. In fiscal year 2004, CMS reviewed approximately 160,000 Medicare claims from the preceding year to learn, more precisely, where errors were being made. This review was the most extensive ever, providing CMS with more accurate information about contractor-specific error rates, error rates by provider type, and error rates by service type. This level of detail and accuracy is critical for CMS to identify where problems exist and target improvement efforts more effectively, and it reflects the agency’s increased commitment to use more detailed data and analysis to identify and eliminate improper payments. “We have developed the best data ever on contractor specific error rates,” said Dr. McClellan. “With this new and detailed information, we are now able to develop specific steps for the Medicare contractors to take more effective actions in reducing the error rates. Using this report and the new, comprehensive data, we can better manage our contractors, making them more accountable to the taxpayers, beneficiaries, and providers, and laying a foundation for the further contractor reforms that we intend to implement in the next few years.” The 2003 analysis identified a large and unexpected increase in the rate of non-responses. CMS adjusted the non-response rate based on past experience with non-responders and other error categories, reporting the 2003 adjusted error rate as 5.8 percent. Without adjusting for the non-response, the 2003 payment error rate would have been 9.8 percent. The 2004 data for error rate analysis was larger and more detailed than the 2003 data, just as the 2003 data was more extensive than data from previous years. Since 1996, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has annually determined the error rate for fee-for-service (FFS) claims paid by Medicare contractors, the insurance organizations that process and pay Medicare claims. From 1996 until 2002, the HHS Office of Inspector General (OIG) using a sample size of about 6,000 claims conducted the process used to measure Medicare payment error rates. The measured error rate declined from 13.8 percent in 1996 to 6.3 percent in 2002. In fiscal year 2003, and as part of the agency’s enhanced efforts to improve payment accuracy, CMS began calculating the Medicare FFS error rate and estimate of improper claim payments using a methodology approved by the OIG for the past two years. Since 2003, the OIG has assisted CMS in developing, reviewing, and formulating further actions based on the more extensive data collection. "The assistance provided by the Office of Inspector General is helping us improve our accuracy and effectiveness in identifying and responding to problems in paying claims,” said Dr. McClellan. “The majority of providers are honest and want to make sure they file their claims correctly so they can be paid timely, and we’re taking new steps to work with our contractors to make sure that happens, as we move forward with fundamental contractor reform over the next few years.” CMS’ more extensive survey, involving a more comprehensive analysis of a larger number and variety of claims, was accompanied by well-coordinated outreach to health care providers to improve claims submissions. CMS established two programs to monitor the accuracy of Medicare FFS payments: The Comprehensive Error Rate Testing (CERT) program and the Hospital Payment Monitoring Program (HPMP). The main objective of the CERT program and HPMP is to measure the degree to which CMS and its contractors are meeting the goal of “Paying it Right.” The 2004 analysis does not adjust the non-response rate, and also includes other data improvements that reflect input from Congress and other oversight partners. In particular, the sample of claims for fiscal intermediaries, who process and pay Medicare Part A claims, was doubled from the prior year so that intermediary-specific error rates could be calculated at the same levels as the Medicare carriers (Part B contractors) and durable medical equipment regional carriers. The data now permits accounting for appeals involving all types of benefits (not just hospital benefits). Thus, the more comprehensive error rates of the last 2 years are illustrative of CMS’ new measurement process. Of the total payments sampled in 2004, results of the new measurement program indicate the following payment error traits: 4.1 percent of payments had errors due to insufficient documentation being submitted (2.6 percent was reported in the 2003 analysis, which included much less information on fiscal intermediaries in 2003); 2.8 percent had errors due to non-responses to request for medical records (an unadjusted 5.0 percent rate was found in 2003); 1.6 percent had errors due to medically unnecessary services (1.3 percent in 2003); 0.7 percent had errors due to incorrect coding (0.7 percent in 2003); and the remaining 0.1 percent had other errors (0.2 percent in 2003). The claims included in this analysis were submitted before many of the agency’s recently-implemented initiatives to reduce error rates took effect. The more comprehensive data provides CMS with the opportunity to enhance and expand its efforts to monitor the impact of these initiatives. As part of its general efforts to further reduce the Medicare error rate, the CMS contractors will be required to: Develop corrective action plans that include efforts to educate providers about the importance of submitting thorough and complete medical records; Identify where additional review of claims and education on submitting claims is needed, based on information that shows where the highest percentage of errors on overused billing codes are occurring; and Use the performance results to develop local efforts to lower their error rates by addressing the cause of the errors and outlining corrective steps. "We've taken major steps in recent years to get much better data on payment accuracy for each and every one of our contractors, and in every case, better measures mean an ability to reduce error rate for those contractors,” said Dr. McClellan. “We've taken a major step this year to improve data on the fiscal intermediaries, and we are now using this information to drive down their error rates in the same way." In addition, CMS is continually developing educational material and information for healthcare providers as part as of "The Medicare Learning Network.” CMS has developed over 250 national provider education articles annually that outline, on a flow basis and in plain language, the coverage, billing and coding rules associated with Medicare program changes.

Wall Street Journal, 2/9/93: "The Most Dangerous Vehicle on the Road" by Walter Olson
  "The Most Dangerous Vehicle On the Road" By Walter Olson Wall Street Journal, February 9, 1993 Jury interviews suggest that last month's $ 105 million verdict in Moseley v. General Motors was based in part on anger at GM's unrepentance: Despite lawsuits and press reports fingering its 1973-87 trucks as unsafe, the company has refused to concede they are flawed at all. Soon after the verdict GM continued its defiance by counterattacking, charging that crash tests done for an NBC expose' in November were rigged by attaching incendiary devices to the trucks. Serious though these charges might seem, some have already dismissed them as GM damage control. Are the trucks, in fact, unsafe? Try to identify from this list the GM truck that Clarence Ditlow, director of the Center for Auto Safety, told NBC was a "rolling firebomb" and that NBC, summing up his charges, described as the "most dangerous vehicle out there on the road." Fatal Crash Rate (per 10,000 registered vehicle years) (National Highway Traffic Safety Administration)
A 1.162 B 1.446 C 1.514 D 1.652 E 1.824 F 2.212 G 2.347 H 2.455 The correct answer is C, the GM full-size vehicle in the Moseley case. (Seventeen-year old Shannon Moseley died in the fire after his GM truck was hit by a drunken driver.) Of the entries on the list with worse records, D represents passenger cars as a general average; E, F, G, and H, light pickup trucks from various makers (Ford, Nissan, Toyota, Chrysler). Of course, one must approach numbers of this sort with caution: For example, models bought by younger and more aggressive drivers may show higher crash rates through no fault of their design. Still, anyone who imagines the GM truck (1.514) an unconscionable death trap would also be wise to avoid the large majority of other vehicles on the road (1.652 to 2.455). Many analysts cry foul at comparing full-size pickups to smaller vehicles, since bigger is known to be safer as a general rule. In the litigation context, that's a strange cavil: If auto makers may freely offer small trucks to the public, why punish them for offering a large truck with a much better safety rating? But in any case, consider B, the full-size Ford entry, which was in fact the market's closest competitor to the GM model. (A, Dodge's full-size entry, did not score a hit with consumers, whatever its safety virtues.) Ford's very thin edge over the GM model may or may not represent anything more than statistical noise, driver bias, and so forth. Anyone who chooses to live in a wood rather than a brick house accepts a far wider adverse safety differential. One policy, of course, would be to punish any firm that fell behind in safety competition, as determined years later in statistical retrospect. That would ensure litigators a steady supply of provender, much as if, out on the veld, they were entitled to munch on whichever gazelles were at the rear of the pack. (The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety has acknowledged, by the way, that the current safety scare is unlikely to add materially to the premiums that GM truck owners pay; the accidents in question are far too rare.) When trial lawyers took their case to the general public through the media, they stressed intuition rather than statistics. It seems that GM, alone among auto makers, had gone about hanging gas tanks on the side of its trucks like dartboards, outside the protective frame rail. The tanks "were placed in about as stupid a place as they can possibly be placed," one of the plaintiff's lawyers informed "NBC Dateline." In a "side impact or a sideswipe impact, " plaintiff s expert Byron Bloch explained to a rapt NBC reporter, "the fuel tank gets crushed ... There is an immediate holocaust." So the overall numbers didn't matter. GM's design choice had invited specific, avoidable deaths, and the company must be punished. As it turns out, neither NBC nor most other news outlets bothered to report that the GM trucks have actually scored better over the years in avoiding fatal crashes when it comes to side-impact collisions, their presumed weak point. Specifically, the full-size GM trucks did slightly better (.196 fatal side-impact crashes per 10,000 registered vehicle years) than the comparable Fords (.200) and almost as well as the Dodges (.190), though the three are bunched so closely together that the numbers hardly matter. How on earth could these trucks have done better in side crashes, given that GM itself chose to move the tanks inboard in a 1988 redesign? Maybe the numbers are a fluke. Or maybe it's that the trade-offs in car safety are not well understood even by experts. Any possible placement of the fuel tank "causes" some accidents and averts others. Respectable designers have tried every gas-tank location at one time or another: front (as in old Volkswagen Beetles), rear (the Ford Pinto and many others), inside the passenger compartment (older trucks), or underneath (now usual, despite the hazards of flying gravel, sparks, ground-slams, and broken axles). All have been rejected at other times as unsafe. Maybe the distinctive narrow frame of GM trucks--popular with customers, but damned by the plaintiff's lawyers because it required the gas tanks to be placed outboard--offers some sort of obscure advantage in side crashes. It's hard to know. We do know that although you are apparently no more likely to have a fatal side-impact crash in your GM truck, if you do have one it is somewhat more likely to involve a fire. To that extent, intuition--but not the trial lawyers' case--is vindicated. We also know that in GM trucks, as in all other kinds, you are much more likely to die in a front-end than in a side crash, and vastly more likely to die in a crash without a fire than in one with. When fire is present in a fatal crash, it's often in the sort of high-force collisions that would have been lethal in any case--though the jury viewed the Moseley case as an exception. And--hardly a surprise given the statistics--it turns out that GM gas tanks are not exactly as fragile or exposed as DDT eggshells, as viewers might have concluded from watching the NBC video or trial lawyer's summations. The tanks not only complied with but far exceeded the U.S. government's safety standards, which specifically address the danger of gas-tank breakage in side crashes. (Fully obeying this kind of law, it turns out, will not keep you from getting sued.) In fact it takes about 4,000 side-impact crashes in a GM pickup to get one fire with a major injury or fatality, which means the supposed "rolling fire-bombs" may compare favorably with haystacks or mounds of feathers as objects to crash into. The more data we see on the safety record of existing cars, the more dubious the safety scares of the past begin to look. The Audi 5000 affair, in which one of the safest cars on the road was wrongly accused of "sudden acceleration," is only the best known of a whole series of lawsuit-driven campaigns that have collapsed in disgrace and refutation. Remarkably, even the affair of the "exploding" Ford Pinto--universally hailed as the acme of product liability success--is starting to look like hype. In a summer 1991 Rutgers Law Review article Gary Schwartz demolishes "the myth of the Pinto case." Actual deaths in Pinto fires have come in at a known 27, not the expected thousand or more. More startling, Schwartz shows that everyone's received ideas about the fabled "smoking gun" memo are false.  The actual memo did not pertain to Pintos, or even Ford products, but to American cars in general; it dealt with rollovers, not rear-end collisions; it did not contemplate the matter of tort liability at all, let alone accept it as cheaper than a design change; it assigned a value to human life because federal regulators, for whose eyes it was meant, themselves employed that concept in their deliberations; and the value it used was one that they, the regulators, had set forth in documents. In retrospect, Schwartz writes, the Pinto's safety record appears to have been very typical of its time and class. Ford, like GM, lost a $ 100 million verdict, although not much of that survived appeal. The scandal of punitive damages is that they're handed down with none of the due-process protections we'd accord targets charged with genuine criminal wrongdoing: strong screening of unreliable evidence, proof beyond a reasonable doubt, prosecution by independent professionals rather than interested parties, and so forth. Until we furnish such protection, punitive damages--as in the Moseley case--will threaten to make a travesty of justice. **** Walter Olson, senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, is the author of The Litigation Explosion.

  The most dangerous squad in Baghdad
By P. Mitchell Prothero
United Press International
Baghdad, Iraq, Jul. 7 (UPI) -- "How'd you end up with us, is this an embed?" the ridiculously young looking soldier asked me as we crouched on the roof of a power transformer station, surveying downtown Baghdad. He's peering down the sight of his belt-fed machine gun at a group of Iraqis located about 500 meters (yards) away towards the Tigris River when he realizes that they're armed. "Shit, shit, they have weapons," he yells across the roof at his corporal. "So fucking kill them," comes the pithy reply from the other ridiculously young solider. "Wait, wait. They're ICDC or ING or whatever the fuck they're called now," yells another. "They're with us." In the last week the Iraqi Civil Defense Corps has been renamed the Iraqi National Guard, a distinction that only means that the Iraqis will not be killed by the four man team that's protecting this impromptu command post. The roof is hot. Baghdad's high temperature on Wednesday is 118 degrees and the men of squad two, second platoon of the 1st Cavalry Division's 1-9 Regiment have already lost three men to the heat and it's only about half past noon. When told that I had just happened to hook up with their unit after being caught in the middle of a running gun battle in central Baghdad, one of the men laughs. "Well asshole, you just hooked up with the most dangerous squad in Baghdad," he says without looking up from his weapon, which is now trained on a small group of men several blocks away who are certainly not ING. Just what might be ordinary bravado from a young soldier echoes across the cement rooftop, his squad-mate clarifies. "No really we are," he says. "Out of the 11 of us, only two haven't won the Purple Heart in the last four months. It sucks to be us." He means that to be in his unit offers a nine out of 11 chance to be wounded in action. Having been quiet for the past 10 days as Iraq saw its sovereignty returned, insurgents picked the morning that the interim Prime Minister Iyad Allawi announced sweeping security measures that effectively allow him to declare martial law to stamp out Iraq's bloody insurgency to attack U.S. and ING forces in central Baghdad. Terror attacks are common in Baghdad. Insurgents attacking convoys and U.S. bases outside Baghdad are frequent. But masked gunmen running through central Baghdad in fire fights with police, ING and U.S. military is unheard of. It barely happened during the invasion of Iraq. The morning began with a mortar attack on Allawi's residence, which we couldn't get close enough to investigate. Then suddenly traffic became even worse than its typically insufferable level. And the sight of U.S. Apache attack helicopters sweeping on firing runs in downtown Baghdad indicated something major was happening. Having deftly avoided much of the traffic, my driver and I were looking for what was happening, expecting a cordon of military vehicles keeping us away from the action. What we didn't expect was that our deftness -- a result of my driver's surreal ability to avoid traffic jams -- would drive ourselves into the middle of a firefight. As bullets flew around our car, which was hastily abandoned, we ran for the shelter of a nearby hospital. We could see U.S. troops far down the broad boulevard. And there was a lot of firing, but we couldn't see who was shooting or at what. But we could hear the bullets smacking trees nearby the now abandoned car and U.S. troops at the end of the road weren't shooting or getting shot at, making the usual calculations of how to safely cover a firefight -- avoid the people getting shot at -- useless. Having decided that the car was a safer option than huddling and waiting to figure out who was doing the shooting, we broke for the car and headed for the nearest Iraqi Police station to find out what was going on. The police station was milling with police carrying assault rifles and some casually mentioned that they were currently under attack from unknown forces. But the shooting had just stopped, likely connected to the missiles fired from an Apache overhead and the black smoke pluming into the sky a few blocks away. Just as the Iraqis were trying to decide whether they were still under attack, three Bradley Fighting Vehicles of the 1st Cav. arrived and dumped three squads of infantry into the area. As they took up defensive positions, they uncharacteristically ignored me, probably due to gunfire directed on their positions. It wasn't well aimed and hit no one in the vicinity, but it caused the platoon leader to send out a squad to stop it. Walking the streets of Haifa -- the neighborhood -- was tense and full of intermittent gunfire, causing the squad to take a solid 30 minutes to travel just a handful of blocks. Having picked the power station as a base, it was checked and gunners assigned to the roof to protect both the station itself and provide supporting fire to a group of ING reportedly a few blocks away. They were pinned down by insurgents and had three wounded men. So several armored vehicles arrived with the rest of the platoon and a rescue mission planned in the small courtyard of the building. It was decided that the rescue operation -- headed to the building four blocks away -- would be done on foot. As the 1st Lieutenant commanding the platoon conferred over maps and with his company commander by radio, a hulking sergeant major addressed the men. "We are expecting resistance, this is full weapons on, men," he bellowed. "If you don't like it, soldier, then shoot it. Shoot boxes or anything you think might be an (improvised explosive device). They are expecting us." Setting out in long lines of men covering each side of the street, the soldiers faced not only the odd gunshot, threat of ambush, or, worse, a roadside bomb, but also the stares of Iraqis who were gathering outside their homes and shops to watch the deadly show. Some scowled, others waved, and the men of second platoon were not happy walking through a rough neighborhood of Baghdad in daylight with little armored vehicle support. And the Apaches had run out of fuel and retuned home so there was no air cover. But as they moved down a side alley along, little happened. Leaving the alley, they broke into the open and quickly established a defensive perimeter around the ING building. One squad ran for the entrance, as the others provided cover, only to find the building locked. "Open this door or I'll open it myself," one soldier yelled at a confused Iraqi man outside the building who clearly had no idea what he was talking about. The ING, it turns out, had already left, even remembering to lock up the facility. "I hate this shit," said the lieutenant. "We have terrible (communications) with the ICDC or ING, or whatever they are. I can't believe this." But even as the group withdraws, one soldier sees something a block away. And a report of men using a nearby house to stage attacks has just come through. Three doors are hit. The first two have only women and children. The third small building has 12 fighting age men in it. And all of their identification is suspicious enough that -- despite the absence of weapons -- it's decided to arrest them for questioning. So second platoon marches their 12 prisoners -- and a growing band of curious reporters -- back the vehicles. As they are loaded into armored vehicles for the ride back to the unit's forward operating base, one of the men manages to slip away and actually sits down at a café down the block pretending like he wasn't involved. A translator for one news organization notices and the reporter innocently asks one soldier why the man was let go. "Get that guy," cries the lieutenant, who then walks over to the café himself and grabs the man, who doesn't even try and deny anything. He just shrugs and follows his friends into the back of the vehicle. Moments later, rifle shots ring out as one soldier notices that the street down the block is now littered with cardboard boxes. He carefully puts a round through each one to make sure none holds a roadside bomb. "You can't be too careful in Baghdad," he shrugs. [UPI Perspectives]

Name: Email: Crime is defined by the Merriam-Webster dictionary as
an act or the commission of an act that is forbidden or the omission of a duty that is commanded by a public law and that makes the offender liable to punishment by that law.   Laws are designed to protect us and ensure our safety in all aspects of our lives: physical, financial, psychological and social.  Yet not a day does go by that we don’t hear of crimes taking place in our city or state.  When a crime is committed, public safety becomes endangered and specific individuals or groups may feel violated.  While we would like to avoid such events, they take place all too often.  Here are some statistics that demonstrate this:
Every two
minutes, somewhere in America, someone is sexually assaulted.
In 2002, there were a total of 4,854 cases of aggravated assault in
Washington DC.  On a daily basis, this computes to 13.2 aggravated assaults a day.
In Maryland, there were 3,228 cases of larceny and thefts per 100,000 people in 2002.  This is one-third higher than the national average rate of 2,445.8 cases per 100,000.
In Detroit, there were 41.79 murders per 100,000 people in 2002.  This is alarmingly way above the national average rate of 5.6 for the same year.
In 2002, with the exception of burglaries, Philadelphia
led all crime levels which were above the national average rates for murder, forcible rape, robbery, aggravated assaults, larceny/theft and motor vehicle theft.
To find out more crime statistics in the
US, visit the
University of Michigan Library.
In addition to crimes against individuals,   
Corporate crime
has recently jolted the corporate world with the likes of the
Enron
scandal and the
Martha Stewart
arrest.  Across
America, worker rights are often violated by threats of firing and other reprisals made to those who dare to exercise their lawful right to collective bargaining and unions.   In 2000, when a department of meat cutters at a Wal-Mart center in
Texas
voted 7-3 in favor of unionization, Wal-Mart eliminated the meat cutting department, choosing instead to pre-cut meats, resulting in the elimination of meat cutting jobs nationwide.  The garment and fabric factories
of
New York
are filled with immigrant workers, many of whom do not have proper working documents. Many of these workers end up enduring poor working conditions for fear of deportation and
INS
investigations, encouraged by the factory owners.  Through collective bargaining, unions protect the rights of workers by giving them fair representation in the work place.  On the contrary, some union leaders have been charged for their involvement in crime activities (racketeering, fraud and tax evasion, embezzlement, and extortion).  Union or not, corporate crime exists on both ends of the continuum, where the workers continue to be victimized and their rights violated.   
Another major type of crime is terrorism.  The tragic events of 9/11 and the terrorists that brought on those acts of destruction have changed the lives of Americans forever.  Support the
fight against terrorism.  
The War on Drugs
deals with addressing the violation of drug laws.  Tremendous resources have been devoted and spent on this war, locally and internationally.  The recent extradition
of drug criminal Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela to the
US
is a sign that indeed the
US
is continuing to wage a war against drug crime.
Social and Economic Problems Caused by Crime
Our social and economic problems are often a direct result of crime.  In a vicious circle, these problems can fuel crime even more.  For example, those who commit theft and burglaries often do so because of their need for money.  These individuals may be unemployed, incapable of finding work, homeless, sick or impoverished.  These crimes become a tempting way to quickly acquire money.  Unfortunately, when left unpunished, these individuals get the misconception that crime pays.  It is this thinking that encourages some individuals to continue their criminal ways, discouraging them from finding other activities that would give them some normality and stability in their lives.  This way of thinking reinforces crime.
Another crime, prostitution, is frequently associated with drug addiction.  Many prostitutes find it difficult to change their work because of their drug addiction.  Drugs require significant cash and prostitution provides this, faster and easier than legitimate work.  Prostitution often will lead to other crimes such as
people trafficking,
sexual abuse, and rape.  Those who exploit women often have no regard for people’s lives.  This disregard often leads to physical abuse and even murder.  In addition, prostitution can increase the spread of diseases such as AIDS, other
STD’s and hepatitis. 
On a larger scale, drug addiction fuels the illicit drug industry.  Through our web site War on Drugs, you can learn more about the social and economic problems that drugs cause.  In organized crime, you will find other violations related to drug trafficking.  These include money laundering, smuggling and illegal sale of weapons, credit card fraud and counterfeiting.  Poverty often leads to the problem of homelessness.  Those who live on the streets often experience hunger and disease making them more likely to resort to committing theft and burglary as a means to eat or to obtain medicine.  Out on the streets the homeless
are exposed more to the risks of drug addiction and other unwanted social behaviors.  All of these factors fuel crime.
Solving the Root Causes of Crime
In order to eradicate crime, we need to address the root causes.  These include, but are not limited to, greed, inadequate corporate oversight, poverty, lack of education, homelessness, drug addiction, racial hatred, and lax gun laws.  Education is one of the biggest factors that plays a role in what becomes of an individual in their adulthood.  Those who have an education possess the training and skills needed to make them marketable to potential employers.  Indeed, even for jobs that pay only a minimum wage, employers likely will prefer interviewing candidates with a decent education over those without.  Thus, many of the uneducated may find themselves unemployed, living in sub-standard housing and in impoverished conditions.  And as money becomes scarce, many of them might be tempted to engage in criminal activities.  At Grassroots.org, we encourage everyone to pursue formal education and stress the importance of governments and universities helping make it accessible to all.  We strongly believe that every American citizen deserves an education and it’s especially important to make it more available to those families who are not able to readily afford it. Education can help eradicate poverty, which will in turn reduce the crime rate.
Poverty often pushes children to drop out of school.  Those children who do not attend school may end up roaming the streets, exposing themselves to criminal elements and activities.  This is why it is imperative that communities provide safe places where children can gather inside, away from street life.  These include school clubs, youth clubs, and sports and recreational centers where children and youth are given support and supervision through educational and developmental programs.  Without alternatives to schools, children can easily get involved in petty crimes such as shoplifting, residential break-ins, car theft and vandalism.  After the petty crimes, these children may graduate into the more serious crimes of drug trafficking, sexual offences and gang violence.
Crime can also be related to the probability of being caught and the extent of possible sentencing.  On our web site Sexual Abuse, we present information showing that most rapes and most acts of sexual abuse are committed by individuals with whom the victims are related or otherwise acquainted.  Such relationships can discourage victims from reporting incidents to law enforcement agencies, thus failing to bring the culprits to justice.  Part of the underreporting problem is the social stigma that is attached to these victims.  Although they are victims, they are often blamed for the crime, labelled as being promiscuous and loose.  This allows the real offenders to get away unpunished, leaving them free to offend again.  As citizens, we need to adopt laws and reporting procedures that will give full physical and psychological protection to victims who report crime.  Let us not allow offenders to get away with their crimes, giving them an opportunity to repeat.
Corporate crime is becoming increasingly global and its consequences can be devastating.  Consumers are defrauded.  Our environment (soil, air and water) is often compromised.  Our personal safety can be placed at risk by lobbyists who buy influence but do not have the interest of the greater majority at heart.  A case in point is the
Federal Ban on Assault Weapons.  The National Rifle Association, a powerful lobbyist organization that opposes the federal ban, including background checks at gun shows, has been a very large donor of money to political parties since 1989.  Although the federal ban and background checks help to ensure our safety, these two issues remain unresolved today.  Visit our web site
Lobbyists
for a more thorough discussion on influence buying.  Scandals such as the Enron accounting fraud have resulted in job loss, pension loss, investment loss, a negative impact on the confidence of the American public on the corporate system, loss of taxes due to the Treasury and more.  Today, as reported by
Citizen Works, there are many other corporations today being investigated for irregular accounting practices.  A few examples are K-Mart, Qwest Communications, WorldCom and Xerox.
We must work to curtail corporate greed.  The practice of “influence buying” needs to be stopped.  Corporations must have tighter controls over their accounting reporting procedures.  We call for greater transparency as well so that irregularities in accounting practices can be detected early to mitigate any damages.  The practice of corporate disclosure needs to be widened.  This will allow consumers and shareholders to become fully aware of corporate records on the environment, human rights, worker safety and financial matters.  It will also allow us to know about corporate criminal records and litigation records.  Multiple functions within consulting firms need to be severed and made independent from each other to prevent conflicts of interest.  The Arthur Andersen firm was caught in such a conflict in the Enron scandal, as the firm served both as the accountants and consultants for Enron.  Arthur Andersen was later found guilty of obstruction of justice.  The company was essentially shut down by that and other accounting scandals.
Our prison rehabilitation and prison systems need reform.  A
report
published by the Urban Institute confirms that although the number of parolees regularly being released from our prison system is large, the number of them going back into prison is alarming.  In 1980, as many as 27,000 parolee violators returned to prisons. By 2000, this number increased to 203,000.  This amount represents a 652 percent increase.  There are a number of reasons for this:
Continuing social problems drive parolees back to crime. 
The number of parole officers is not enough to handle the demand of case loads. 
Educational and vocational programs for inmates in prisons need improvement.
Prison personnel need more training in prison based inmate rehabilitation.  This will ensure a higher success rate of inmate re-integration in to society.  Many private prisons have high staff turnover, chronic understaffing and inexperienced correctional officers.  These private prisons are focused primarily on profit, with the inmates being secondary concerns.
If those in charge of our prison system give priority first and foremost to the rehabilitation and re-integration of inmates, this in turn will have a positive effect on the reduction of crime.
Calls to Action
As law abiding citizens, it is imperative that we live our lives according to the rules of our land.  It is also our civic duty to report any crimes that we witness.  The reasons are simple: our laws are meant to preserve the quiet and peaceful enjoyment of living in this great country of the
United States.  Anytime a law is broken, it can compromise the safety of our citizens.  What makes our nation so great is the freedom given to us by our forefathers: our freedom of speech, of religion, of protest, to vote, to get an education, to go to work, to information and many more!  These freedoms are valuable and precious to all of us.  These freedoms are the reasons why the
UShas waged several battles on crime including the War on Drugs and the War on Terrorism. 
Although the costs of these battles are plenty, the rewards are worth it.   9/11 has changed our lives forever, no doubt.  Today, there are Americans who still live in fear of when and where the next terrorist attacks will happen.  Immediately after the strikes on the
World
Trade
Center, such fear was overwhelming and widespread.  There is great debate on whether the
US
is winning the war in
Iraq.  Many question whether our soldiers should even be there.  However, there is no question that 9/11 has not repeated itself in
USsoil. There is also no question in our minds that the War on Drugs is having a positive effect given the fall and extradition of many Colombian drug lords.  Grassroots.org is asking you to support our law enforcement agencies.  Give encouragement to those who put their lives on the line to protect our freedoms.  And most importantly, let each of us live according to the laws of our nation.  Democracy is powerful.  Freedom makes the war on crime even more worth it!

Background information
Conference of the Parties
Address by Ambassador Luigi Lauriola, Chairman of the Ad Hoc Committee on The Elaboration of a Convention Against Transnational Organized Crime at The Millenium Assembly of the United Nations General Assembly, New York, November 2000 The Convention represents a major step forward in the fight against transnational organized crime and signifies the recognition of UN Member States that this is a serious and growing problem that can only be solved through close international cooperation. The Convention, concluded at the 10th session of the Ad Hoc Committee established by the General Assembly to deal with this problem, is a legally binding instrument committing States that ratify it to taking a series of measures against transnational organized crime. These include the creation of domestic criminal offences to combat the problem, and the adoption of new, sweeping frameworks for mutual legal assistance, extradition, law-enforcement cooperation and technical assistance and training. States Parties will be able to rely on one another in investigating, prosecuting and punishing crimes committed by organized criminal groups where either the crimes or the groups who commit them have some element of transnational involvement. This should make it much more difficult for offenders and organized criminal groups to take advantage of gaps in national law, jurisdictional problems or a lack of accurate information about the full scope of their activities. The Convention deals with the fight against organized crime in general and some of the major activities in whichï¿½transnational organized crime is commonly involved, such as money laundering, corruption and the obstruction of investigations or prosecutions. To supplement the Convention, two Protocols also tackle specific areas of transnational organized crime that are of particular concern to UN Member States. The Protocol against the Smuggling of Migrants deals with the growing problem of organized criminal groups who smuggle migrants, often at high risk to the migrants and at great profit for the offenders. The Protocol against Trafficking in Persons deals with the problem of modern slavery, in which the desire of people to seek a better life is taken advantage of by organized criminal groups. Migrants are often confined or coerced into exploitive or oppressive forms of employment, often in the sex trade or in dangerous occupations, with the illicit incomes generated from these activities going to organized crime. The Protocols also commit countries which ratify them to making the basic subject of the Protocol a criminal offence and to adopting other specific measures, such as controls on travel documents, to combat the problem. These supplement the more general measures found in the Convention, and countries must become parties to the Convention itself before they can become parties to any of the Protocols. A third Protocol, dealing with the illicit manufacturing of and trafficking in firearms, parts and components, and ammunition, remains under discussion. The texts of these documents were developed over 11 sessions of the Ad Hoc Committee, and footnoted texts may be found under each session. The Convention was finalized at the 10th session, and the complete text forms part of the Report of that session. The Protocols dealing with the smuggling of migrants and trafficking in persons were finalized at the 11th session and are reported there. These three instruments were adopted by the UN Millenium General Assembly on 15 November 2000, and final texts are included in the Report of that session. Instruments Finalized instruments: United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime and following protocols: Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children, supplementing the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime Protocol against the Smuggling of Migrants by Land, Air and Sea, supplementing the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime (PDF) English,

Organized Crime
This compilation of resources focuses on adult gangs, gangsters, the mafia, and international gangs. For more information about youth gangs, look under Gangs. "Transnational organized crime will be one of the major problems facing policy makers in the 21st century. It will be a defining issue of the 21st century as the Cold War was for the 20th century and Colonialism was for the 19th. No area of international affairs will remain untouched as political and economic systems and the social fabric of many countries will deteriorate under the increasing financial power of international organized crime groups." -Louise Shelley, Director of TraCCC.

http://www.nagia.org/Crips_and_Bloods.htm
Surprisingly, little has been written about the historical significance of black gangs in Los Angeles (LA). Literature and firsthand interviews with Los Angeles residents seem to point to three significant periods relevant to the development of the contemporary black gangs. The first period, which followed WWII and significant black migrations from the South, is when the first major black clubs formed. After the Watts rebellion of 1965, the second period gave way to the civil rights period of Los Angeles where blacks, including those who where former club members who became politically active for the remainder of the 1960s. By the early 1970s black street gangs began to reemerge. By 1972, the Crips were firmly established and the Bloods were beginning to organize. This period saw the rise of LA’s newest gangs, which continued to grow during the 1970s, and later formed in several other cities throughout the United States by the 1990s. While black gangs do not make up the largest or most active gang population in Los Angeles today, their influence on street gang culture nationally has been profound. Article by Alejandro A. Alonso.

http://www.nagia.org/Hybrid_Gangs.htm
As the "gangsta" culture continues to spread throughout North America, the influence of California and Chicago gangs are now being felt in both large metropolitan areas and with increasing frequency in small, rural communities. The lesson has been well-learned that the problem of street gangs is one that touches all ethnic and socio-economic classes. However, as law enforcement agencies have attempted to deal with the gang problem in their respective communities, some very significant differences have been discovered from the historic perception of these gangs, and their behaviors in areas outside of Chicago or Los Angeles.

http://usinfo.state.gov/regional/ea/chinaaliens/polishprof.htm
Paper delivered by Professor Emil W. Plywaczewski, Ph.D., at the 3rd Annual Symposium "Crime and Its Control in Greater China", June 21-22, 2002, University of Hong Kong, PRC. Summary: Chinese organized crime has become well established in every major Chinese community across the world, Plywaczewski says. Members include community leaders as well as ordinary workers. "It is difficult to penetrate this subculture," Plywaczewski writes, "because members have no prior criminal records.... They can conceal their criminal activities through their involvement in lawful business activities." Plywaczewski provides detailed information on Chinese people-smuggling operations in Austria, Hungary, Poland and other European countries. He notes that Chinese criminal groups operate in isolated "cells," each with a specific duty and unaware of other cells in the criminal operation except the one from which it accepts assignments. In the case of people smuggling, some organizations will, for a higher fee, provide their "customers" with "a guarantee of effectiveness." That is, the smugglers guarantee that they will get their client to a target country no matter how many times they might be stopped by law enforcement.

http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/nij/international/chinese.html
The organizational structure of Chinese organized crime in the United States is quite complex. Broadly defined, there is a great variety of Chinese criminal organizations. These include gangs, secret societies, triads, tongs, Taiwanese organized crime groups, and strictly US-based tongs and gangs. According to Ko-lin Chin, the foremost academic expert in the U.S. on Chinese organized crime, there is no empirical support for the belief that there is a well-organized, monolithic, hierarchical criminal cartel called the "Chinese Mafia." Chin says: "My findings...do not support the notion that a chain of command exists among these various crime groups or that they coordinate with one another routinely in international crimes such as heroin trafficking, money laundering, and the smuggling of aliens" (1996:123).

http://www.fbi.gov/hq/cid/orgcrime/ocshome.htm
Organized crime, in the U.S. and around the world, is a critical concern of the law enforcement community. The cooperation among these organized criminal enterprises in recent years has allowed them to greatly increase the scope and magnitude of their illicit activities. Our world has seen widespread and unprecedented political, economic, social, and technological changes in the last two decades. Organized criminal enterprises have been quick to take advantage of the opportunities created by these changes to satisfy their greed and lust for power. The cost to communities and individuals, in terms of pain and suffering caused by the violence and exploitation associated with these organizations, is incalculable. Also the damage to society resulting from these criminal organizations and their influence on labor unions, political institutions, financial markets, and major industries is immeasurable. In fact, a look at the economic impact alone gives a glimpse of the importance of this issue. The Center for Strategic and International Studies, Global Organized Crime Project, Financial Crimes Task Force estimates global organized crime reaps profits of close to $1 trillion per year. The FBI's fight against organized crime is unlike other criminal programs. Instead of focusing on these crimes as individual events, the FBI's Organized Crime Program targets the entire organization responsible for a variety of criminal activities. The FBI has found that even if key individuals in an organization are removed, the depth and financial strength of the organization often allows the enterprise to continue.

The rapid spread of international crime since the end of the Cold War is unprecedented in scale, facilitated by globalization and technological advances, and poses a significant challenge to the United States and democratic governments and free market economies around the world. The President has identified international crime as a direct and immediate threat to the national security of the United States. To meet this challenge, the Departments of Justice, State, and Treasury--working closely with numerous federal agencies--jointly developed a comprehensive national strategy to fight international crime and reduce its impact on Americans. The International Crime Control Strategy, which was released in May 1998, provides a dynamic action plan that serves as a roadmap for a coordinated, effective, long-term attack on international crime.

This web page is intended to address global organized crime and it's growing importance for international security. This issue is emerging in international relations as a primary component in security and foreign policy making. Global organized crime activities are elusive because many global orgainzed crime groups operate through a variety of high tech means, which are difficult to trace. The groups operations have global implications such as illegal biological, nuclear, and chemical weapons trade. With the high stakes of global organized crime it is imperative that the international community develop a means to deal with these issues.

La Cosa Nostra or LCN -- also known as the Mafia, the mob, the outfit, the office -- is a collection of Italian-American organized crime “families” that has been operating in the United States since the 1920s. For nearly three quarters of a century, beginning during the time of Prohibition and extending into the 1990s, the LCN was clearly the most prominent criminal organization in the U.S. Indeed, it was synonymous with organized crime. In recent years, the LCN has been severely crippled by law enforcement, and over the past decade has been challenged in a number of its criminal markets by other organized crime groups. Nevertheless, with respect to those criteria that best define the harm capacity of criminal organizations, it is still pre-eminent. The LCN has greater capacity to gain monopoly control over criminal markets, to use or threaten violence to maintain that control, and to corrupt law enforcement and the political system than does any of its competitors. As one eminent scholar has also pointed out, “no other criminal organization [in the United States] has controlled labor unions, organized employer cartels, operated as a rationalizing force in major industries, and functioned as a bridge between the upperworld and the underworld” (Jacobs, 1999:128). It is this capacity that distinguishes the LCN from all other criminal organizations in the U.S. James O. Finckenauer, Ph.D., National Institute of Justice.

http://www.rcmp.ca/ccaps/media_e.htm
The Canadian public is exposed to extensive media coverage of events related to organized crime (OC). Every day, an impressive array of stories appear in both print and broadcast media. A study carried out last year estimated at more than 27,000 the number of articles that referred to organized crime in 15 Canadian dailies and magazines over a six-year period (Beare & Ronderos, 2001). This massive exposure is significant, as the media are among the sources of information people count on to mould their opinion of the world around them. And with respect to crime, surveys have shown that up to 95% of people say they rely on the media as their primary source of information in this regard (Graber, 1979). Given the extensive OC media coverage here in Canada and its role as a possible source of public information in this regard, it seems imperative that we answer the following question: Does media coverage of OC-related events influence public opinion, and, if so, how?

(Last checked 06/15/04) Media Coverage of Organized Crime : Police Managers Survey
http://www.rcmp.ca/ccaps/media_coverage_e.htm
Police managers feel that the media tend to focus too much on organized crime activities that involve violence. Because of this emphasis on violence and sensationalism, the media often underplay organized crime activities with no apparent violence. The activities downplayed the most by the media, in terms of impact, are money laundering and economic crimes. Police managers also stated that the media give too much exposure to positive or socially acceptable events linked to organized crime. They consider, however, that police operations, trials and political interventions related to organized crime receive adequate and relatively proper coverage. Police managers are concerned about a lack of in-depth articles, editorials and feature stories that could provide an in-depth look at issues related organized crime. According to some managers, the biggest shortcoming is that the media never provide a comprehensive view of the actual causes and overall impact of organized crime in Canada.

Once considered nothing more than rowdy toughs on two-wheelers, motorcycle gangs have evolved into crime units that are sufficiently well-oiled and well-organized to rival the Mafia. It's not just police officers who lump these groups together. Documented evidence in state, provincial and federal courts throughout the United States, Canada, Europe and Australia suggests that motorcycle gangs have become organized crime entities equal to the Mafia on many fronts. Biker gangs are organized internationally, with chapters in Europe, Australia, South America and Africa. As retired Illinois State Police Sergeant Joe Satercier noted in 1993 at a Chicago-area Outlaw Motorcycle Gang training seminar, "Biker gangs are the only sophisticated organized crime groups that we export from the United States."

http://www.sgc.gc.ca/publications/policing/1998orgcrim_e.asp
Over the past few years in Canada and around the world the topic of organized crime (OC) has attracted increased concern and attention. With this concern has come the need to better understand the phenomenon in its entirety. While many OC studies have been produced that describe or examine a particular OC activity or OC group, relatively little attention has been focused in any systematic way on the impact of OC on Canada, Canadians and their communities. The Organized Crime Impact Study (OCIS) addresses this issue. It does so not by focusing on OC groups but rather on the impact of key activities, such as the illicit drug trade, that organized criminals participate in and help sustain. Highlights from a study by Samuel Porteous for the Solicitor General Canada. The first attempt to measure the impact of organized crime on Canada.

The third section addresses the underground economy in the latter years of the Soviet Union as the framework from which the current Russian mafia, the subject of the fourth section, developed.

Russian organized crime constitutes a direct threat to the national security interests of the United States by fostering instability in a nuclear-armed power. Left unchecked, Russia is in jeopardy of becoming a criminal syndicalist state under the control of corrupt government bureaucrats, politicians, quasi-businessmen, and criminals. Composed of senior-level U.S. government representatives and private-sector experts, the task force assesses the breadth and depth of Russian organized crime and corruption, addresses current U.S. policy, and makes recommendations on how best to confront these challenges.

http://www.ncis.co.uk/threat_assessment.html
This report gives a picture of serious criminal activity with organized crime groups (OCGs) involved in a diverse range of crime sectors, with the aim 'first and foremost to make money'. As well as traditional high-profile crimes such as drug-trafficking, robberty, extortion, theft and fraud, there is increasing concern over intellectual property theft (IPT) -- both in its own right and contributing to other criminality. The report draws attention to the sheer scale and complexity of counterfeiting -- especially of consumer goods - whether they are manufctured in the UK or in the cheap labor markets of the Far East. While UK Conterfeiting is often perceived as an activity by low level criminals, counterfeiting is, in fact, highly profitalbe and has a hevy involvement by organized criminals in the 'production, buying, importing and distribution of all types of counterefeited products'. The other misperception is that counterfeiting does not merit priority attention by law enforcement agencies but the report highlights that "the profits from IPT can help OCGs to become more established and to fund other various criminal activities'.

The International Crime Problem
International Training
Interagency Working Group
Legal Attache Program
Grave crime is no longer bound by the constraints of borders. Such offenses as terrorism, nuclear smuggling, organized crime, computer crime, and drug trafficking can spill over from other countries into the United States. Regardless of origin, these and other overseas crimes impact directly on our citizens and our economy. We have developed a variety of anti-crime efforts both here and abroad to combat these dangerous threats. This effort has been undertaken with the support of the President, Attorney General Janet Reno, and Secretary Warren Christopher. One of the most effective ways to fight international crime is by building cop-to-cop bridges between American law enforcement and our overseas counterparts. Without these relationships, there cannot be the commonality of purpose and open communication required for success. More and more of these bridges are being built, and successes are flowing from them. We are using a number of approaches to develop cooperative law enforcement programs with other countries. For example, our Legal Attache Program works closely with a large number of foreign police forces. Not only do they cooperate on specific cases, but our Legal Attaches -- who are highly-skilled senior FBI Agents -- also form a sort of distant early warning system to alert us to new and emerging crime threats. Another very powerful tool is training: the FBI places a high priority on assisting our foreign law enforcement counterparts through training courses here and abroad. And just a year ago, we took a major cooperative step with other Federal agencies and other foreign nations with the creation of the International Law Enforcement Academy in Budapest. These and other programs combine to help give the FBI the critical foundation needed to effectively combat international crime. There is also another vital factor: I want to thank this Committee for its crucial recognition of the importance of these issues and for your support in meeting the crime challenges from abroad. This is a rare opportunity to extend the Rule of Law while mobilizing law enforcement to meet the explosion of international crime against America. I am exceedingly grateful for the support Congress has given us and pledge to continue to work with Congress as we develop a stronger global network of effective law enforcement. Your support of law enforcement training at the Department of State has been critical to the success of our programs. The International Crime Problem
The political, social, and economic changes occurring in Eastern Europe and in the former Soviet Republics have provided significant, unintended opportunities for organized crime groups and criminal enterprises in these countries to expand internationally. Evidence that organized crime activity from these areas is expanding and will continue to expand to the United States is well-documented. These criminal enterprises are not a new phenomenon to Russia. They existed under Communism. Appropriate legal tools were not created to control organized crime and corruption activities. When Communism declined in the Soviet Union, the organized crime groups quickly expanded their influence in the emerging move toward Capitalism, again because sufficient constraints and law enforcement tools were not present. The FBI has many years of successful investigative and prosecutorial experience in the battle with La Cosa Nostra and other organized crime groups here in the United States. We view organized crime as a continuing criminal conspiracy having a firm organizational structure, a conspiracy fed by fear and corruption. This definition can also be applied to the organized crime threat facing Russia and many other countries. Members of a typical Russian organized crime group are found at every level of society. Organized crime activity in Russia includes monetary speculation, manipulation of the banking system, and embezzlement of state property, as well as contract murder, extortion, drug trafficking, prostitution, protection rackets, and infiltration of legitimate business activity. To make matters worse, a number of Russian/Eurasian organized crime groups and criminal enterprises presently operate in the U.S. Many of these criminal enterprises active in the U.S. have demonstrated a willingness to work in close concert with other non-Russian/non-Eurasian organized crime groups. The United States and Russia fully realize the need for joint cooperation against crimes that harm both countries -- and other parts of the world as well. That is the reason the FBI has opened a Legal Attache Office in Moscow to work closely with Russian police against a variety of costly crimes. From July 1994 to the present, the number of cases worked by the FBI Agents in Moscow has increased from 20 to over 200. If Congress agrees, and with the cooperation of the Department of State and the Department of Justice, we hope to expand our network of Legal Attache Offices around the world. The global needs are great -- and many nations, including Russia, are working diligently to fight crime that hurts the law-abiding everywhere. One of the specific issues of great concern to the FBI and to Russian authorities is the theft and diversion of nuclear materials -- and the potential theft of nuclear weapons by terrorists or rogue nations. Over the past year, legitimate concerns have been raised by the apparent vulnerability of radioactive materials to theft or diversion in several areas of Eastern Europe and Eurasia. The seizure of significant amounts of cesium in Lithuania and the seizure of uranium in the Czech Republic are examples of the concerns in the international community regarding the threat of nuclear proliferation. The recent increases in radiological-nuclear material incidents throughout the world have caused the international law enforcement community to communicate better with each other. Although there have been no seizures of nuclear material in the United States, two recent cases involved conspiracies to import radioactive material into this country. In New York, the U.S. Customs Service arrested foreign nationals attempting to negotiate the sale of radioactive zirconium metal into the U.S. Ultimately, 45 tons of the material were seized in Cyprus, enroute to the U.S. In the other case, the Canadian Customs Service intercepted radioactive isotopes originating in Russia being smuggled into the U.S. through Canada. The FBI assisted the Canadian law enforcement agencies in their investigation. While some crime problems flow from East to West, others flow back from West to East. One of the most difficult law enforcement problems facing many of the newly-freed and Eastern European nations is drug trafficking. The scourge of drug trafficking has had a devastating impact on the entire global community. Russia, the Newly Independent States and Eastern Europe are certainly not immune to this epidemic. Criminal organizations in these emerging democracies are taking advantage of the relaxed borders and improved telecommunications systems that have emerged in recent years to facilitate their illegitimate operations. These countries are targets of opportunity for the major drug trafficking organizations, like the Colombian cartels, which seek to establish new and lucrative markets. International Training
The FBI's international approach in combating Russian and other international organized crime groups includes general and specialized law enforcement training for foreign law enforcement agencies. During Fiscal Year (FY) 1995, the FBI trained 4,400 foreign law enforcement personnel. This training is particularly critical with respect to the police agencies of some of the newly-emerging democracies. Most of this training is accomplished by funding generously made available by Congress to the Department of State through the Freedom Support Act (FSA) and Support for Eastern European Democracies (SEED) funding. The FBI and the Department of State, working together, are also responsible for the International Law Enforcement Training Academy in Budapest, which functions as the center for law enforcement training for officers from many Eastern European, Russian and Eurasian nations. The Academy at Budapest provides an eight-week professional development program similar to our FBI National Academy Program at Quantico. During FY 1995, a total of three classes graduated from the Budapest Academy -- each of 33 mid- level police officers. Those officers came from the Czech Republic, Hungary, Latvia, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Estonia, and Lithuania. For FY 1996, the schedule is much more aggressive, calling for approximately 200 persons to be trained from the following countries: Albania, Belarus, Bulgaria, Croatia, Estonia, Hungary, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Latvia, Macedonia, Moldova, Poland, Russia, Slovenia, and Ukraine. We can be immensely proud of the Academy at Budapest. It is a direct outgrowth of our trip to Eastern Europe in 1994 and President Clinton's direction to U.S. Government agencies to join together to build the world's capabilities in fighting international crime. The Academy represents the combined efforts of the Department of State (DOS), the Department of Justice (DOJ), the FBI, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), the United States Secret Service (USSS), the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center (FLETC), the Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms (ATF), and other agencies and countries. It is truly a case where all of these law enforcement agencies are working together as partners toward a common goal. I cannot speak highly enough about the contributions ATF, DEA, Secret Service, IRS and the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center in the Department of Treasury have made in making the Academy succeed. The Academy brings together seasoned investigators as instructors and law enforcement officers from across Eastern Europe, Russia, and the Newly Independent States to learn policing under the Rule of Law. I am especially grateful to our host country, Hungary. Just last week, I along with my other counterparts from the United States were honored to attend the dedication of the International Law Enforcement Academy. With the recent completion of renovations, the capacity of the Academy has been expanded. The dedication was an historic moment in international law enforcement. The FBI also is involved in foreign police training in many other valuable ways. For example, in FY 1995, the FBI performed a total of 10 In-Country Training Needs Assessments. It works this way: at the invitation of the host government, we analyze that country's police training needs and capabilities. We then make a recommendation of how we believe we can best assist the host country's law enforcement capabilities through specifically targeted training. The assessments were conducted in Albania, Belarus, Bulgaria, Estonia, India, Kazakhstan, Kyrgystan, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova, Paraguay, Peru, Poland, Romania, Tunisia, Ukraine, and Uruguay. Through the FBI's In-Country Training Program, the FBI conducts one and two-week schools in foreign nations which concentrate on police operations and technical skills. We use seasoned, senior FBI street Agent instructors who use their extensive practical experience in training our foreign counterparts in policing under the Rule of Law. The instructors in these programs have an established expertise in criminal investigations, especially organized crime and white collar crime. Their credibility is not only essential for effective instruction but also is very effective in building the cop-to-cop bridges that we so critically need. Since the first of the year, we have trained 212 officers of the Ministry of Interior for the Russian Federation (MVD) in seminars held in Russia and at the FBI Academy in Quantico. Along with the instruction geared to the investigation of crimes, we have provided training in ethics and internal police controls -- the first time that this has ever been done and an area which is critical to the success of policing under the Rule of Law. Our In-Country Training Programs are primarily funded through the FSA and SEED funds we receive from the Department of State. The FBI, along with other law enforcement agencies, submit proposed international training plans to the Department of State at the beginning of the Fiscal Year. Depending on the funding that is available for law enforcement training, the Department of State then determines the funding amounts for each agency. During the past two years, the FBI has received $8.3 million of these funds for our training initiative. We have been very pleased with the support we have received from the Department of State -- all the training we have proposed has been funded. In addition, the FBI has used $300,000 of its appropriated funding to provide limited training to law enforcement in other countries. In FY 1995, the FBI provided FSA and SEED supported training seminars to over 1,800 law enforcement officers from Hungary, Poland, Slovakia, Czech Republic, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Ukraine, Russia, Romania, and Moldova. In FY 1996, we will expand our training into Belarus, Slovenia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgystan, Bulgaria, and Albania. The training provided is tailored to meet the needs of the participants. Topics addressed include bank robbery, drug trafficking, kidnapping, financial crimes, white-collar crime, organized crime and terrorism. Just recently, for example, we conducted a white-collar crime and corruption seminar in Kazakhstan. All of this training has a direct impact on United States persons and corporations who have flocked to these countries in search of business opportunities. In addition to the training funded by the FSA and SEED Acts, the FBI trained an additional 2,600 students through our other programs. These programs included the crime-specific investigative seminars, targeted crime scene analysis training as provided by our forensic experts, and management training for mid-level and executive law enforcement officers. Last year, 110 international officers also participated in the FBI National Academy program at Quantico. Their participation allows an additional "bridge" to be built from our state and local officers to those overseas. One beneficial part of this training is the opportunity it provides the trainers and the trainees to interact about specific crime problems being encountered in their countries, how to address the problem, share experiences learned in the process and forge new relationships for future cooperation on matters of mutual interest and concern. In some of our investigations, the FBI has benefitted by bringing actual case investigators to the U.S. from other nations to work side by side with FBI Agents. This is a continuation of the training we have provided and allows "hands-on" application and observation of investigative techniques successfully employed by the FBI in our organized crime investigations. As examples of the successes the FBI has seen from contacts and liaison established as a result of this training, a Central European working group on international organized crime and a six-nation working group on international organized crime were established this past year. In addition to the FBI, they bring together law enforcement agencies from Eastern and Western Europe and Canada to discuss specific organized crime threats common to all countries represented. Lines of communication and working relationships are now established and practical law enforcement approaches to the organized crime problems of the regions are planned. As a direct result of this initiative, several countries were, for the first time, able to establish continuing liaison communications with other represented organizations on a direct professional level and to initiate joint investigations. For example, a multi-national, case-specific fraud seminar was conducted by the FBI's Financial Crimes Section from February 18-22, 1996, in Berlin, Germany. The program dealt with bank failures and brought together investigators from the United States, Latvia, Netherlands, Russia, and Germany for a practical case training initiative. The resulting product of these constructive meetings is an investigative organized crime task force, international in scope, that is targeting significant criminal organizations determined to be a major threat to many nations, including the United States. The FBI also presented a nuclear non-proliferation conference at the FBI complex at Quantico, Virginia from April 18-21, 1995, and twenty-eight (28) SEED and FSA nations sent representatives, including, among others, Russia and Ukraine. The conference outlined the problems of nuclear materials and weapons proliferation from the countries of the former Soviet Union and counter-proliferation proposals and training initiatives. The conference is included as a FSA initiative to address this serious problem. The Department of Defense and the FBI are currently in the final stages of submitting the DOD/FBI Counterproliferation Program report to Congress regarding plans to provide international training seminars on nuclear smuggling. This is part of our Nunn-Lugar funded international training seminars program on nuclear smuggling. The FBI's Nuclear Biological Chemical Proliferation Unit is presently in possession of a report compiled by an FBI team that recently conducted a training assessment in the Czech Republic. During this assessment, which was coordinated by our Legal Attache in Vienna, the FBI representatives from the International Coordination Unit, the FBI Laboratory and the Engineering Section, met with various Czech law enforcement agencies, Czech nuclear safety officials, and faculty members of the Rez Institute. This assessment yielded valuable information regarding the concerns and needs of the attending Czech officials. It is proposed that the information provided by the Czechs, with regard to their specific requirements, will result in establishing a training prototype for other countries requesting support in counterproliferation matters. Interagency Working Group
As this Committee is fully aware, the Congress established the Interagency Working Group (IWG) to make recommendations as to training and other support received by Russia, the Newly Independent States, and other Eastern European countries. This has been a successful endeavor that greatly assists us in the proper coordination of our training efforts abroad. The IWG allows all Federal law enforcement agencies to participate in Department of State FSA and SEED funded training initiatives within the former Soviet Union and Bloc nations, based on their respective law enforcement jurisdiction. Participation in the IWG prevents duplication and waste of resources. IWG priorities are formulated by the Departments of State, Justice and the Treasury, as dictated by the various law enforcement entities from those departments, participating on the IWG. The FBI participates as a member of the IWG in carrying out the programs under the auspices of the FSA and SEED. Let me describe the FBI's role: The FBI, as the agency with the broadest Federal law enforcement responsibility, conducted a major portion of the training and technical assistance during FY 1995, with a similar schedule planned for FY 1996. The FBI has exclusive training in the area of organized crime. Other participating agencies like the Drug Enforcement Administration and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms, likewise have exclusive areas of training based on their expertise and jurisdiction. In other areas, such as economic crimes, training by the United States Secret Service, U.S. Customs Service, FINCEN, and DEA compliments that done by the FBI. Legal Attache Program
The FBI's Legal Attache Program is the single most significant factor in the Bureau's ability to detect, deter, and investigate international crimes in which the United States or our citizens are the victims. By stationing Agents abroad and establishing operational links with foreign police, the FBI substantially expands the nation's perimeter of law enforcement protection. Generously funded out of the Commerce, State, and Justice Bill, the FBI's Legal Attaches are truly our first line of defense. International crime has grown enormously in recent years. Technological advances and the end of the Cold War prompted dramatic increases in global travel and telecommunications. Criminals have used these changes to their advantage, diffusing their operations around the world to avoid law enforcement scrutiny. The relentless globalization of crime threatens America both at home and abroad -- and all other law-abiding nations as well. For better or for worse, the global village is now a late-20th century reality. Our experience shows that placing FBI Agents at critical posts abroad provides the most reliable, effective and timely means to combat international crime -- and often at the source. It is essential to station highly-skilled agents in other countries to prevent foreign terrorism and foreign crime from reaching the United States. At present, the FBI has in place in our Legal Attache Offices 70 senior Agents and 54 support personnel in 23 nations around the world, funded out of FBI operational funds. During FY 1995, these offices handled over 11,200 matters. They are the conduit through which law enforcement information and cooperation flows between the United States and its foreign partners. Their goal can be defined succinctly: to keep foreign crime as far from American shores as possible, to keep foreign crime permanently at bay whenever possible, to help combat more effectively those crimes that do reach our borders. The whole point is to protect the American people from harm. FBI Agents stationed overseas are not intelligence officers; they are not a shadow intelligence agency; and they do not engage in espionage. They are law enforcement Agents-- dedicated to fighting organized crime, terrorism, nuclear smuggling, violent crime, drug trafficking, and economic crime. Let me give a few examples of the direct benefits made possible because our agents are overseas and have the cop-to-cop relationships with host authorities critical to effective law enforcement. For over 15 years, FBI Agents in Rome have had a close working relationship with all the major Italian police services. Through one joint investigation which began in 1991, it was determined that members of the Sicilian Mafia, Camorra, and 'Ndrangheta were collaborating with the Colombian drug cartels in shipments of cocaine to Italy and heroin into New York. In that investigation -- which utilized sophisticated investigative techniques, including electronic surveillance -- the FBI worked closely with the Italian police services, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, and Colombian judicial authorities. As a result of our combined efforts, 89 people were arrested in the United States, Italy, Canada, and Colombia. Since their arrests, 30 of these people have been convicted in the United States alone. Kobi Mowatt, a fugitive from the United States, was recently arrested in Tanzania with assistance from our FBI Legal Attaches. Mowatt, an alleged member of the notoriously violent "First and Kennedy Street Crew," from Washington, D.C., is charged with conspiring to participate in a racketeering organization by committing acts of murder, robbery, kidnapping, and drug dealing. He was charged in a 53-count indictment with participating in four homicides, including a triple murder here in Washington in 1994. With direct assistance from our Legal Attaches, and the considerable assistance of foreign police agencies, the FBI was able to track Mowatt through Russia until his capture in Tanzania. Last month, he was brought back to the United States to stand trial. In a major move against a growing Russian organized crime structure in the United States, the FBI last year arrested Vyacheslav Kirillovich Ivankov, allegedly one of the most powerful Russian crime leaders in this country, along with five of his associates on Federal charges of conspiracy to commit extortion. The arrests in New York followed an intensive FBI investigation that was aided greatly by the Russian Ministry of Interior and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and made possible because of our Legal Attaches and the relationships that have flowed from cooperation abroad. The arrest was based upon Federal arrest warrants which charge a total of nine individuals. According to Russian law enforcement authorities, Ivankov formed a substantial criminal organization in Russia before he entered the United States allegedly to manage and control Russian organized crime activities in this country. Russian organized crime groups use businesses in the former Soviet Union, Western and Central Europe, and the United States to serve as fronts for laundering the proceeds of illegal activities and for conducting highly profitable commerce in goods in the successor states of the Soviet Union, known as the Commonwealth of Independent States. In November 1994, several of the defendants allegedly began to extort several million dollars from American and Russian businesses. Intelligence information was shared on a continuing basis among the FBI, the Russian MVD and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. FBI Legat participation was critical. Last August, Eyad Ismail was apprehended abroad and brought back to New York to face an indictment charging him with taking part in the terrorist bombing of the World Trade Center that killed six people and injured over 1,000. As the complaint alleged, Ismail fled the United States the night of the bombing. He was taken into custody after an extensive investigation greatly facilitated by an FBI Legal Attache. Last April, Ramzi Yousef and Abdul Hakim Murad were indicted in New York for a conspiracy and attempt to bomb United States commercial airlines serving air routes in the Far East. The indictment alleges that as part of the conspiracy, Yousef placed a bomb in a foreign airliner that exploded and killed one passenger. Yousef was already facing charges relating to the bombing of the World Trade Center in New York. With critical assistance from FBI Legal Attaches, Yousef was tracked to Pakistan, apprehended, and extradited to the United States to stand trial. Murad was identified and likewise extradited to the United States. Both await trial. Most recently, four Russians were charged in New York for conspiring to defraud 24 Russian companies, including a charity established to aid the victims of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster, of approximately $10.8 million. Many other important cases have been made possible only because the FBI Legal Attaches are able to freely work with our foreign counterparts toward the mutually-shared goal of effective law enforcement under the Rule of Law. The FBI is deeply grateful to Congress for the support and contributions for our Legal Attache Program. A relatively few Agents beyond our borders make a contribution out of proportion to their small numbers and the modest amount of dollars spent. As part of the FY 1996 Appropriations process, our Appropriations Subcommittees have asked us to prepare a plan reflecting our assessment of both the short and long-term Legal Attache expansion needs. We have been working closely with the Departments of Justice and State to provide Congress with a carefully thought-out plan designed to better meet the challenges we face from exploding international crime and terrorism. This plan -- which is under final administrative review -- is a realistic, down-to-earth assessment of the vast changes that have occurred in recent years in the world, especially in Europe with the breakup of the former Soviet Union. I am most grateful to our House and Senate Committees for their leadership. Quite candidly, Congress has taken planning for FBI Legal Attache Offices out of the choppy one-year cycle and prompted us to develop a long-term, comprehensive response to a rapidly changing and worsening international crime situation. Once completed, I am looking forward to discussing the plan with Congress. I am extraordinarily grateful for the support Congress has given these programs. In my view, this represents capitalizing on a rare opportunity to protect our citizens by being both prepared and sufficiently aggressive as crime moves into the global arena. At the same time, I wish to thank the Department of State and Secretary Christopher for supporting the FBI's foreign police training efforts and for their leadership on the IWG. Since my trip to Moscow and Eastern Europe in 1994 we have had an ongoing and productive dialogue about our training initiatives -- indeed, an extraordinary partnership has formed. In addition to Secretary Christopher, Deputy Secretary Strobe Talbott, former Assistant Secretary Richard Holbrooke, Ambassador Robert Gelbard, U.S. Ambassador to Hungary Donald Blinken, and many others -- both here and abroad -- have been instrumental in promoting these programs.

GLOBAL ORGANIZED CRIME
Woodrow Wilson School Policy Conference 401A Intelligence Reform in the Post-Cold War Era
Conference Director Diane C. Snyder GLOBAL ORGANIZED CRIME Mora Stephens January 6, 1996 I pledge that the following paper represents my ideas in accordance with the university Honor Code. ____________________________
GLOBAL ORGANIZED CRIME AS A THREAT TO NATIONAL SECURITY
Global Organized Crime in the Post-Cold War Era
Since the end of the Cold War and the subsequent refocusing of Intelligence away from the Soviet Union, Global Organized Crime has been recognized as a priority threat to national security. Global Organized Crime has been defined by FBI Director Louis J. Freeh as "a continuing criminal conspiracy having a firm organizational structure, a conspiracy fed by fear and corruption." The international crimes that extend over foreign borders and into the United States include drug trafficking, extortion, money laundering, arms smuggling, bribery, and fraud schemes. In recent years these criminal groups have dramatically increased the scope of their activities by taking advantage of many Post-Cold War opportunities such as the lowering of economic and political barriers; the end of communist regimes and the founding of fragile new democracies; the increase in legitimate international trade; and the advances in technology that facilitate global communication and transport. The Administration, Intelligence and Law Enforcement have reacted to the new organized crime groups, emerging on a global scale after the Cold War, by creating a strong national response. The current system is not "broken." However, the threat itself is growing in terms of its scale and complexity at a such a fast rate that it is important to look at possible ways in which the national response to Global Organized Crime can be improved. In order to understand the significance of improving current policy and national efforts against Global Organized Crime, the changing nature and seriousness of the threat must first be understood. The Changing Threats
Emerging threats vs. Familiar problems
Global Organized Crime in the Post-Cold War Era pose some familiar national security threats and some threats that United States did not previously have to address. The security concerns that existed during the Cold War include: political instability of foreign governments, international drug trafficking and arms transfers to hostile parties. Global criminal leaders present new puzzles within these familiar threats. Former Director of the CIA, R. James Woolsey, described the difficulties of applying traditional national security methods when addressing Global Organized Crime, ...the tools of diplomacy are ineffective and irrelevant in dealing directly with these criminal groups. Even under the most difficult, intractable period of the Cold War, if consensus was not possible, communication was, nevertheless, feasible. Not so in the world of organized crime. Although we do negotiate with our key allies and friends to better attack the problem, there is no negotiating table where we can try to work out a compromise or reach a consensus with criminals.... In addition, certain distinctions can be made between Global Organized Crime and terrorism. While many terrorist groups that engage in violent acts are motivated by specific political causes, such as Egyptian Islamic Fundamentalist terrorists who use violent means to protest their country's current government and Western influences, most organized crime groups are only interested in political power for the security it would provide their organization and are primary motived by money. The international economic threat, posed by Global Organized Crime, in an increasingly global economy is among the major "new" threats to national security. The major economic powers and the less developed nations did not previously share a collective problem of this nature. Global Organized Crime does not just affect a select group of financial institutions or regional areas, it affects international financial networks and economies at a national level. These threats present new conflicts that will require innovative strategies in the future. Global Cooperation among Organized Crime Groups Cooperation among Global Organized Crime groups has increased as restrictions have lessened between international borders. These foreign havens for criminals and their assets have made it increasingly difficult for Law Enforcement to trace illegal profits; gather evidence on the criminal leaders; and identify and contain criminal groups. When Law Enforcement activities in Florida reduced the amount of Colombian cocaine being smuggled into the U.S. through the Carribean islands, the Colombian drug cartel leaders simply began working with their Mexican counterparts instead of their Carribean partners. Another example of an international partnership is Columbian drug lords selling methamphetamine to American dealers in the U.S., the ingredients for which were produced through Colombian connections to organized crime in Europe, Asia and the Far East. These global networks allow organized crime groups to greatly increase the profits of their operations and their methods of evading local governments as they share information, skills, costs, market access and relative strengths. Threat to Global Economy
Transnational organized crime groups pose more of a threat to international financial markets as the world economy becomes increasingly interdependent. Laundering billions of dollars in organized crime money worsens national debt problems because the large sums of money are then lost as tax revenue to that country's government. Russian organized crime groups are actively involved in banking, according to FBI official James Moody, because public financial institutions are "the most vulnerable and lucrative target." The Russian Interior Ministry has estimated that organized crime "controls" most of Russia's 200 banks and half of its financial capital ("control" ranges from ownership and operation to influence over bank decisions through threats of violence). U.S. and Western businesses in Russia, in particular, are frequent targets of extortion, robberies, threats and murder. Security costs for these businesses (especially physical protection, extra protection of cargo, and forced payments to gangsters for "protection,") often consume more than 30% of profits. The fear generated combined with organized crime monopolies in certain industries, such as the agriculture and construction markets in Columbia and Venezuela, damages the overall economy because it discourages legitimate, innovative businesses and entrepreneurs (foreign and domestic) from entering the market. Political Impact
Global Organized Crime can have a damaging effect on political structures, especially the fragile new systems of government found in the former communist or totalitarian regimes. South American drug cartels have a destabilizing effect on governments through their financial support of local guerilla rebels, such as the Sendero Luminoso in Peru and the Revolutionary Armed Forces in Columbia, who share their animosity toward the government and who exchange protection for money and arms supplies. The Sicilian Mafia have used their economic power over local businesses and banks and their supplies of cash to corrupt politicians, judges and Law Enforcement, assassinating many of those public figures who will not cooperate. Media polls indicate that the many Russians believe the "mafiya" is more powerful than the government. As people feel that the government is powerless to stop organized crime, they turn to crime leaders for protection and political institutions begin to deteriorate. Fear of organized crime undermines the credibility of political reform and may encourage support for anti-democratic, hardline politicians such as Russia's Vladimir Zhirinovsky who promised during the 1993 campaign to end organized crime in 3 months through mass arrest and execution. The Potential for a Major Nuclear/Arms Theat The global networks of criminals, terrorists and corrupt government officials and their complex methods of smuggling goods could easily be transferred to the smuggling of nuclear materials on a massive scale. While Global Organized Crime has become increasingly more involved in the transfer of arms, encouraged in part by conflicts in the Balkans and former Soviet Union which proved to be profitable for the Russian and Italian mafia, the smuggling of nuclear materials seems to be currently isolated to select incidents and mostly to amateurs. Russia no longer has the nuclear materials protection that it had during the Cold War when materials were controlled by a tight, centralized system under a politically powerful government. In the past year, the FBI has seized major shipments of nuclear materials in Eastern Europe, including large seizures of cesium in Lithuania and uranium in the Czech Republic. As Global Organized Crime groups become more powerful and as nuclear materials become more vulnerable (through poor management, underpaid desperate workers in the nuclear facilities, and government corruption) the threat becomes more serious. Damage to Society caused by International Drug Trafficking International drug trafficking poses a threat to the social fabric of all countries. The increase in the scale of these operations has led to an increase in drug use, addiction, and general crime level. The common U.S.-Mexico border alone causes a tremendous increase in the American drug problem: 60-70% of cocaine in the U.S. enters at this border through a Mexican-Columbian organized crime partnership. Other European organized crime groups use this border to transport heroin, marijuana, and methamphetamine. It is becoming increasingly difficult to track the flow of narcotics into the United States as the drug cartel methods become more technically sophisticated: redesigning the interiors of Boeing 727s to hold maximum amounts of cocaine; transferring drug profits electronically to dozens of banks around the world in less than 24 hours; and using falsified export documents and invoices for goods in order to disguise drug trafficking transactions. THE CURRENT NATIONAL RESPONSE TO GLOBAL ORGANIZED CRIME
The Administration
President Clinton and the current administration have acknowledged the threat of Global Organized Crime by supporting new anti-crime legislation and by highlighting the issue in public forums. Reducing transnational crime, according to President Clinton, is a part of the challenge of "making sure America remains the strongest force in the world for peace and freedom, security and prosperity" as it enters the 21st century. Presidential Decision Directive-42 (PDD-42), created by President Clinton, recognizes that Global Organized Crime is a threat to national security. The directive orders government agencies to "use creatively and aggressively all legal means to combat international organized crime,"creates the authority to deny visas to a broad range of organized criminals, and sanctions authority against governments that cooperate with or provide sanctuary to organized crime figures. While PDD- 42 brought public attention to the issue of international organized crime, it did not expand or change current policy. President Clinton merely highlighted the topic with PDD-42 and repeated older policy. In comparison, PDD-35 may prove to have a significant effect on the threat because it will affect the amount of Intelligence resources devoted to global crime. PDD- 35, which defines intelligence requirements, declares that intelligence collection and analysis of international criminal and drug activities should be a high priority. The President has also actively supported the International Crime Control Act of 1996 which addresses Global Organized Crime with measures that include expanding the definitions of money laundering, eliminating the statute of limitations for all federal criminal offenses committed outside of the United States and encourages global cooperation among governments through joint-law enforcement programs. The Act will provide U.S. Law Enforcement with a little more flexibility overseas in their investigations and arrests of international criminals. It is possible for the President to lead a government-wide initiative against a new security threat. In the late 1940's, the U.S. developed a strategy for containing Soviet sponsored communism. This unified plan of action included the Marshall Plan, military build-up, development of long-standing alliances (especially NATO), public diplomacy efforts to rebuild foreign democracies and the focusing of the Intelligence Community on the problem. The Post-Cold War Era has a different world context, but the successful strategy can still serve as a model for intergovernmental cooperation. Law Enforcement and Intelligence
Different Perspectives on Global Organized Crime
Containing organized crime traditionally has been the domain of law enforcement agencies while addressing national security concerns has been primarily the field of the Intelligence Community. Transnational crime blurs the line between "domestic" and "foreign" affairs because the criminals have a global impact: they are based in foreign countries, but have international ties, including many in the United States. The Law Enforcement perspective on Global Organized Crime is that it is a major cause in the increasing domestic and international crime levels. Law Enforcement seeks to reduce global crime through arrests and successful prosecutions of the international organized crime leaders. The Intelligence perspective examines global crime in terms of its political and economic impact overseas and as a threat to national security. Intelligence agencies pursue information on Global Organized Crime that will assist Law Enforcement in their investigations but are primarily concerned with providing policy-makers with global crime intelligence. The differing perspectives on Global Organized Crime reveals larger differences between Law Enforcement and Intelligence. Since the Law Enforcement mission is to enforce the law and provide information to court trials that will establish proof beyond a reasonable doubt, they are acutely sensitive to evidentiary requirements when collecting information. Intelligence agencies, because of their mission to provide policy-makers with relevant national security intelligence, collect information for their own analysis and are more concerned with preserving their sources than placing them under the public scrutiny of trials. Generations of Law Enforcement and Intelligence officials working for different missions have resulted in a mutual distrust of working together; while Intelligence worries about protecting its sources and methods when assisting a criminal investigation, Law Enforcement is concerned about protecting their evidence. The Law Enforcement Approach
The Department of Justice seeks to reduce Global Organized Crime by presenting a strong Law Enforcement presence overseas. In recent years, FBI Legal Attache offices alone have grown to 70 Senior Agents in 23 countries. The Legal Attache program works closely with foreign police on specific cases and acts as a "distant early warning system" to alert the FBI of emerging crime threats. Director Freeh has focused on "building cop-to-cop bridges between American law enforcement and our overseas counterparts" and views this as being the most effective means of fighting international crime. The FBI programs in the U.S. and overseas that train foreign law enforcement officers are a central element of this partnership. The model for global cooperation through training is the recent creation of the International Law Enforcement Academy in Budapest. Although the FBI has been successful in building an increasingly extensive network of police force partnerships, the Law Enforcement approach to Global Organized Crime does have its limitations. Director Freeh has suggested that "such international law enforcement problems are not solved by merely an intelligence community response. It is not a matter of spy- counterspy. Instead, it requires a law enforcement response..." Despite Director Freeh's persuasive arguments, there are certain obstacles for a law enforcement response. Collecting evidence beyond a reasonable doubt in Global Organized Crime cases is more difficult because the international networks allow criminals to hide their tracks in different bank accounts, partners, and storage areas around the world. The overall effectiveness of prosecuting these criminals is also questionable in cases when a crime leader is brought to trial, and his organization simply promotes a different criminal to that position in order to continue with its operations. The Intelligence Approach
As part of its new role addressing non-traditional threats of the Post-Cold War Era, Intelligence makes contributions of Global Organized Crime information to Law Enforcement and policy-makers. Former DCI John Deutch redirected the Intelligence Community's resources and activities toward assisting Law Enforcement to "identify, target and apprehend" criminals engaged in illegal trafficking and smuggling. The CIA has reorganized the Director of Central Intelligence's Counter-Narcotics Center into the DCI Crime and Narcotics Center. The new center has tried to provide greater opportunities for law enforcement agencies to gain "actionable intelligence" on specific global crime groups. According to David Carey, Director of the DCI Crime and Narcotics Center, intelligence collection has been primarily directed at the structure of international crime networks and the political and economic impact of the threat. HUMINT (Human-Source Intelligence) has proven to be the most effective Intelligence discipline in collecting information on global crime. In SIRs prepared at the request of the DCI and under the auspices of the National Intelligence Council, HUMINT was graded as being critically more important for narcotics intelligence than all other intelligence disciplines put together. The global networks of organized crime groups interacting with other criminal groups, terrorists and corrupt officials, are not easily observed using the technical methods that were successfully employed for national security concerns during the Cold War. They can, however, be penetrated by human sources. Human agents, through their internal access to the criminal groups, provide information on future dangers and weaknesses of the criminal networks, and without the use of covert action, disrupt and isolate international criminal groups by allowing Intelligence to place them under intense scrutiny. Although the National Security Act of 1947 prohibits the CIA from having domestic Law Enforcement powers, the CIA continues to be involved in Global Organized Crime cases that have domestic elements. Many transnational criminals have connections to American citizens and operate parts of their organization in the United States. For example, over 200 of Russia's estimated 6000 organized crime groups operate with American counterparts in 17 U.S. cities spread out across 14 states. Reagan's Executive Order 12333 clarifies CIA statutory authority in this area by authorizing the CIA to "participate in law enforcement activities to investigate or prevent clandestine intelligence activities by foreign powers or international terrorist or narcotics activity." Cooperation with Law Enforcement allows the CIA to remain active in cases with domestic elements. The CIA, under E.O. 12333, participates in the international aspects of the global crime case and Law Enforcement then handles the domestic aspects that involve U.S. citizens or other areas of domestic involvement. Cooperation Between Intelligence and Law Enforcement Problems in coordinating overseas activities between Intelligence and Law Enforcement have resulted from the greatly increasing number of overseas Justice Department agents (especially FBI), overlapping responsibilities, lack of a clear hierarchy for coordination, different missions and concerns over the risks involved in cases. Law Enforcement agencies alone have problems with inefficient overlap and interference of cases. In April 1992, five Law Enforcement agencies had duplicating analysis of drug smuggling movement by air into Mexico. There is controversy over Law Enforcement coordinating activities with the Ambassador although it is required by law to do so (22 U.S. C. 3927). Law Enforcement expresses interest in keeping the Ambassador informed of its activities but is reluctant to involve him in prosecutorial decisions. On an inconsistent basis, Law Enforcement coordinates the recruitment of confidential informants overseas with the Chief of Station. Although the Chief of Station and Law Enforcement representative are under the authority of the Embassy, there is not a clear hierarchy or set of guide-lines for coordinating activities. Since there is not a single individual or group to organize individual activities, the FBI often acts independently of Intelligence and vice versa. Intelligence and Law Enforcement, from worker to director levels of authority, have created projects to improve coordination between the communities. A special task force is trying to clarify guidelines for cooperation between Intelligence and Law Enforcement overseas. A Joint Intelligence Community-Law Enforcement (JICLE) working group (comprised of lawyers and officials from both sides) was created in 1995 and meets on a weekly basis to help devise solutions to common problems. The recommendations of the JICLE have included Intelligence- Law Enforcement training programs that overcome mission and community culture barriers through education on the laws, regulations, and procedures that facilitate coordination. The new Transnational Threats Committee of the NSC, which includes the DCI and the Attorney General, provides the first formal opportunity for overseas coordination problems to be solved at the highest levels of authority. Global Cooperation
Law Enforcement and Intelligence have found that international cooperation is one of the most effective solutions to transnational problems. The Law Enforcement Community has made significant advances in global cooperation through delegations of American law enforcement leaders visiting foreign counterparts, cooperative criminal investigations, and training programs for foreign Law Enforcement. The Aspin-Brown Commission found that Intelligence derived great benefit from such cooperative arrangements as: exchanging requests for collection; exchanging analysts and technicians; and assisting foreign countries to acquire collection capabilities in order to share the results of future collections. While U.S. Intelligence Community might not want to pursue a thorough "spy-to-spy" method analogous to FBI Director Freeh's "cop-to-cop" approach (due to the inherent risks to sources and methods), the IC still needs to continue global cooperation efforts. In many cases, global cooperation is worth the risk because it provides access to geography, skills, contacts and information that would be otherwise unavailable. ALTERNATIVES TO CURRENT POLICY TOWARD GLOBAL ORGANIZED CRIME
Direction from the Administration
The Aspin-Brown Commission's Preparing for the 21st Century: An Appraisal of U.S. Intelligence recommends that the President by Executive Order reaffirm that global criminal activities are national security matters and require a multi-agency response. The recommendation further suggests that "a law enforcement approach is inadequate." If implemented, this recommendation would have almost zero costs and obstacles but would create little improvement on the present situation by providing no additional funds, manpower or plans for action. The President has already recognized these issues in PDD-35, PDD-42 and through his support for the International Crime Control Act of 1996. The additional Executive Order would not contribute significantly to the reform effort. Legislative Boundaries
The Aspin-Brown Commission recommends an E.O. that would clarify that intelligence agencies with collection capabilities may collect information about non-U.S. persons outside the United States at the request of Law Enforcement. The Commission does not specify if Intelligence would participate based on its own volition and if Law Enforcement could actually task Intelligence. "Tasking," as opposed to "requesting information," would imply a certain amount of Law Enforcement control over Intelligence during the case. The recommendation would basically leave the situation as it is currently but would officially recognize the legality of Intelligence agencies collecting for Law Enforcement. There is a reluctance on the part of the Intelligence Community to accept direct collection requests from law enforcement agencies. NSA and CIA refuse to be directly tasked by Law Enforcement and will only proceed with a collection request on a specific target if they first determine that there is a "foreign intelligence" purpose. This formal requirement is often a mere procedural formality because most requests are determined to be relevant to foreign intelligence. Unfortunately, the requirement can also create tension between the two communities by fostering the perception that Intelligence is unwilling to assist Law Enforcement. Instead of the President creating an E.O., the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal year 1997( IAA97) responded to the Aspin-Brown recommendation with an amendment to the National Security Act of 1947 that clarifies Intelligence assistance to Law Enforcement. Section 105A states "elements of the intelligence community may, upon the request of a United States law enforcement agency, collect information outside the United States about individuals who are not United States persons." The careful wording still implies that Intelligence will participate based on its own volition. If it had been phrased as "Law Enforcement may request that...", it would have had slightly different connotations. As it is currently written, it follows the Aspin-Brown model, and officially authorizes the current Intelligence-Law Enforcement collection procedures without trying to significantly improve them. The amendment, as it was recommended by the Commission, will provide some benefits to Law Enforcement and Intelligence cooperation and will have little costs. The CIA and NSA will benefit by collecting for Law Enforcement with less concern about their legal authorities being questioned. Law Enforcement will benefit from a probable increase in collection requests that are answered. In evading the more controversial question of collection responsibilities and overseas tasking, the Aspin-Brown recommendation and IAA97 also had fewer implementation obstacles. The House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence's IC21: Intelligence Community in the 21st Century recommend that no additional clarifications of the law be made in terms of coordination and cooperation between Law Enforcement and Intelligence. They suggested that there is already enough flexibility and a workable set of legal boundaries in the current laws and standing Executive Orders. E.O. 12333 provides reasonably flexible boundaries for Intelligence assisting Law Enforcement in international criminal cases. Despite these arguments a clarification of the law, as the Aspin-Brown Commission recommended and IAA97 created, still provided some benefits. Lack of precise legal authorities can hamper, delay or side-track cooperation and communication efforts between the two communities. Coordination between Law Enforcement and Intelligence
Global Crime Committee The Aspin-Brown Commission, HPSCI and the Council on Foreign Relations reports agree that the Intelligence and the Law Enforcement Communities need a better mechanism for finding solutions to disagreements and for forming cohesive strategies. The Aspin-Brown Commission recommends that the President create by Executive Order a Global Crime Committee of the National Security Council to direct the U.S. actions against transnational security threats. The committee would be chaired by the National Security Advisor and the core members would include the Director of Central Intelligence, the Attorney General, and the Secretaries of State and Defense. Unfortunately, the Secretary of Treasury is not included among the core members even though his input would be important when the Committee discussed such transnational threats as financial crimes and illegal smuggling. The new committee would identify specific transnational groups that require a coordinated response; establish an overall strategy and monitor its implementation; develop improved procedures for sharing relevant information between the two communities; and develop guidelines to govern the coordination of law enforcement overseas. The recommendation for the creation of this committee is the one of the most significant efforts by the intelligence reform reports to improve the national strategy toward Global Organized Crime. Instead of the President using an Executive Order, Congress responded to the Aspin- Brown Commission's recommendation by creating the Committee on Transnational Threats, under section 804 of the Intelligence Authorization Act of FY 1997. With the exception of the committee's name and a few minor differences, the new Committee follows the model created by the Commission in their recommendation. Unlike the Transnational Threats Committee, previous Intelligence and Law Enforcement working groups, task forces and meetings were not held at a director level, and were not focused on forming a national strategy but rather on resolving individual conflicts between the communities. The Aspin-Brown recommendation succeeded in convincing the Congressional committees to create the Transnational Threat Committee but the real obstacle remains insuring that the directors actually use this opportunity to forge better cooperation instead of a superficial collaboration. The major cost of the committee is pulling already busy leaders away from other activities. The potential benefits of improving the national approach toward global crime will outweigh the costs. The Committee, as it was modeled after the Commission's recommendation, blends all international criminal threats into one label of "global crime" or "transnational threats." While some of the security and diplomacy issues are similar, Global Organized Crime and terrorist groups have different organizational networks, agendas, and weaknesses. They also pose different economic and political threats. While the Transnational Threats Committee will address both of these issues, it should be aware that strategies that are responsive to the differences in Global Organized Crime and terrorism will be more effective in reducing each threat. Single Law Enforcement Representative The Aspin-Brown Commission recommends that the President designate the Attorney General as the focal point and spokesperson for formulating the Law Enforcement strategy for global crime, facilitating cooperation with Intelligence and coordinating overseas Law Enforcement activities. Currently, Law Enforcement responsibility is split between the Attorney General (whose department includes FBI, DEA and INS) and the Secretary of Treasury (whose department includes Secret Service, Customs Service, and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms). The majority of Global Organized Crime issues fall under the Attorney General's responsibilities but Global Organized Crime cases that involve smuggling goods into the U.S., money laundering and other financial crimes, fall under the jurisdiction of the Secretary of Treasury. They should both be included in forming national strategies and in representing Law Enforcement as they direct departments with different responsibilities and resources. The additional Treasury perspective provides more significant benefits than the gain in efficiency that a single representative would provide. The HPSCI report similarly opposes the Attorney General acting as the single representative or the FBI acting as the lead agency of Law Enforcement. HPSCI argues that it would be a mistake to ignore overseas law enforcement agencies outside of the Justice Department. This is an important recommendation because while the FBI has provided innovative solutions to global crime and should continue to be active in influencing the improvement of the overall law enforcement strategy, it is not the only agency involved in overseas activities. Priority in the National Strategy and Coordination
Since effective coordination requires strong leadership, the Aspin-Brown Commission and the Council on Foreign Relations Report suggest that a coordinated national effort against global crime would benefit from Intelligence taking priority over Law Enforcement. According to the Aspin-Brown Commission, in order to coordinate daily activities overseas, Law Enforcement should play a subordinate role under the Ambassador and the Chief of Station. However, HPSCI argues against Intelligence taking immediate priority over Law Enforcement and only recommends that the Chief of Station and the Ambassador be "kept reasonably informed of law enforcement objectives and plans." While Intelligence agencies can make a significant contribution to policy-makers forming decisions on Global Organized Crime, they should not necessarily be given priority over Law Enforcement. The CFR's suggestion that Intelligence be given priority "lest pursuit of evidence or individuals for prosecution cause major foreign policy problems or complicate ongoing Intelligence and diplomatic activities" does not justify subordinating Law Enforcement. In many foreign countries, American Law Enforcement agents and their local activities are eagerly welcomed by the foreign governments who are concerned with stopping their national crime problems. There may be more distrust of American Intelligence. Since the majority of Law Enforcement cases are overt and carried out with the coordination of foreign police, there is little danger of Law Enforcement causing a "major foreign policy problem." RECOMMENDATIONS
Recommendations for the new Transnational Threats Committee:
1.This study recommends that the Committee include the Secretary of Treasury when addressing such issues as illegal smuggling and financial crimes. The agencies under the Department of Treasury, in addition to those under the Department of Justice, are actively involved in the national effort against transnational crime. Global crimes that fall under the Treasury jurisdiction include: narcotics and other contraband smuggling (U.S. Customs Service); counterfeiting American money (U.S. Secret Service); money laundering and financial crimes (Financial Crimes Enforcement Network). One obstacle to implementing this recommendation is the argument that inviting the Secretary of Treasury would be unnecessary because the Attorney General is already representing Law Enforcement in the Committee. While the departments under the Attorney General are also involved in these areas, there are some situations where Department of Treasury would be more affected and more importantly, the Committee and its national strategy would benefit from the Treasury perspective. 2.The Committee should set up a practical, working hierarchy overseas to conduct Intelligence and Law Enforcement activities under a coordinated policy. One of the stated functions of the Committee is to "develop guidelines" for coordination overseas but it is necessary to specify that the Committee needs to set up guidelines for a specific hierarchy, if coordination reforms are to be effective. There is already interest in both communities in improving coordination of activities overseas. But in actual practice, Law Enforcement often acts independently of Intelligence and vice versa because lines of authority overseas can become blurred. Problems with communication are due there not being a single person or group to lead and organize the individual activities. It is further recommended that the Chief of Station (COS) be in charge of the actual coordination of these activities. As the head of the Embassy, the Ambassador should be kept informed of both Intelligence and Law Enforcement activities but his personal involvement in the details of coordination should continue to depend on the individual Ambassador. The Committee should give the Chief of Station clear guidelines for organizing activities and the authority necessary to accomplish efficient coordination of resources. They should clearly define the COS and the Law Enforcement responsibilities to each other as well as to the Ambassador. The major obstacle could be opposition from the Attorney General and Law Enforcement officials (especially FBI) who are supportive of greater cooperation but who are rapidly increasing their activities overseas and do not want to see their freedom limited by the Chief of Station. Another concern is that unless the Committee sets up clear lines of authority, it may be difficult for the Chief of Station to coordinate activities and ensure that Law Enforcement adheres to the guidelines. 3.The Committee should form a separate proactive strategy for Global Organized Crime and Drug Trafficking Networks. The IC, in order to avoid wasting resources through duplication, must recognize the similarities between Global Organized Crime and other transnational threats. However, the different activities and potential vulnerabilities of Global Organized Crime must also be acknowledged by the Committee if it is to form an effective strategy against the threat. For example, an intelligence strategy for Global Organized Crime might focus on gathering information on the international money laundering networks. Since laundered money is necessary to continue the daily operations of these criminal networks, a concentrated multi- agency attack on the money laundering channels could be debilitating to Global Organized Crime groups and Drug Traffickers. While terrorist groups can also be involved in money laundering, this strategy may not be as successful in preventing terrorist attacks. From the other perspective, strategies used against terrorism may not prove to be as effective against organized crime. Implementing this recommendation would strengthen the national effort against Global Organized Crime by producing a coordinated strategy specific to its own concerns. The costs would be low because it would not necessarily entail devoting more resources to addressing the threat but rather using the existing resources more effectively. Certain Committee members may oppose the recommendation on the belief that it would be a waste of resources to devote the Committee and the agencies they represent to one transnational threat when they could take advantage of the similarities of the threats. However, the importance of having a "Transnational Threat" committee instead of having a "Global Organized Crime" committee already takes advantage of these similarities by pooling the leaders and resources involved in all of these threats. Within the Committee, the differences should also be recognized. 4.The Committee should create more liaison programs between Intelligence and Law Enforcement dealing with Global Organized Crime. The two communities are already participating in programs like this, but since the benefits are significant, the Committee should encourage cooperation and integration on a working level through more programs. On a case by case level, they would benefit from the different perspectives and on a higher level of authority, they would benefit from the joint programs because it would help to facilitate future cooperation. The cost of adding more joint projects is relatively small when compared with the benefits of cases that result in greater intelligence gathering/prosecutions and in less resources being used overall because manpower and technology have been shared between the communities. 5.This study recommends that the Committee make efforts to improve coordination with foreign governments. Global cooperation is necessary to fight criminal groups with increasingly interconnected networks around the world. FBI Director Freeh has been very successful in establishing working partnerships with foreign Law Enforcement and governments. He sees building "cop-to-cop" connections as the key to fighting global crime. Just as strengthening the coordination between domestic agencies is a necessary step toward a more effective national strategy, improving coordination between American and foreign agencies is also an important part of reducing Global Organized Crime One obstacle would be the reluctance of Intelligence to work even closer with foreign governments, their intelligence agencies and their Law Enforcement. In the case of Russia, many law enforcement officials accept bribes from organized crime and detectives are sometimes forced to not report to their superiors for fear that the suspects will be warned of raids and arrests. Intelligence may not want to work too closely with foreign intelligence agencies in order to protect their sources and methods. However, there is always an intelligence problem of trust when dealing with human sources but the successes of HUMINT demonstrate that the benefits are worth the risks. 6.This study concurs with the HUMINT and Non-proliferation conference studies' recommendation for further use of HUMINT in dealing with transnational threats. These underground networks can be penetrated by human sources. Human agents can learn the complexities and vulnerabilities of an international network of criminal individuals and groups. The expensive satellite imagery that was helpful in collecting information on large military sites during the Cold War may not be that effective in collecting information on Global Organized Crime. There are more risks involved in trusting human sources but it is more effective in dealing with Global Organized Crime and the costs are low when compared with technical collection. Recommendations for the President: 7.This study recommends that the President confer regularly with the Transnational Threats Committee while forming his national strategy on Global Organized Crime. The new Committee offers the President an incredible opportunity to combine all of the separate abilities and interests represented by the DCI, the Attorney General, the Secretaries of State and Defense, under a unified set of anti-global crime objectives. Since IAA97 also states that the President may designate additional members, he has even more opportunities to use the Committee to respond to his needs with regard to transnational threats. The major obstacle is the President's own disapproval of the creation of the Committee. In his statement on signing the Authorization Act regarding the new Committee, he wrote, "Such efforts to dictate the President's policy process unduly intrude upon Executive prerogatives and responsibilities. I would note that under my Executive authority, I have already asked the NSC to examine these issues." The combined decisions of Intelligence and Law Enforcement leaders should provide insights into creating a coordinated policy that the NSC had previously not provided. The President frequently speaks about the importance of addressing transnational threats so he should be more interested in forming an effective solution-oriented policy against them. 8.The President should support the continuation of both the Attorney General and the Secretary of Treasury acting as representatives of Law Enforcement. The President should not select the Attorney General as the single representative for Law Enforcement. The Attorney General already acts as the Law Enforcement spokesperson in many areas dealing with Global Organized Crime. In areas that pertain more to the Treasury, such as financial crimes, the Secretary should continue to be brought in as a representative. MEASURING SUCCESS OF THE REFORMED INTELLIGENCE RESPONSE TO GLOBAL ORGANIZED CRIME
9.The Transnational Threats Committee should make formal annual assessments on the effects of the changes made through the reforms described above and address the weaknesses in the implementation. Reform and improvement of coordination should be a continuous process and the Committee needs to form a systematic way to continue reform of Intelligence and Law Enforcement coordination and the national response to Global Organized Crime. Possible areas for them to examine would be if there was a more cohesive national strategy; if activities overseas were actually being coordinated under the Chief of Station or if Law Enforcement officials were acting independently; and if, as a result of the reforms, there were improvements made in the Global Organized Crime assessments given to policy-makers. The President and his staff should also make a yearly assessment of the success of the Committee. He should provide feedback on how the Committee could better respond to transnational threats and provide him with information relevant to formulating a national strategy. Actual trends in Global Organized Crime and individual cases of major crime groups should be analyzed to determine if the coordinated response formulated by the Committee had an impact on the threat.

ARCPR: CRITICAL REFLECTIONS ON INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZED CRIME, MONEY LAUNDERING, AND CORRUPTION The Canadian Review of Policing Research (2004) ISSN: 1710 6915 CRITICAL REFLECTIONS ON INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZED CRIME, MONEY LAUNDERING, AND CORRUPTION Margaret. E. Beare
Margaret Beare
is an associate professor in the Sociology Department of York University and the Director of the Nathanson Centre for the Study of Organized Crime and Corruption at Osgoode Hall Law School, York University. What follows is a summary of a recently published book entitled Critical Reflections on Transnational Organized Crime, Money Laundering, and Corruption, published in 2003 by the University of Toronto Press, Toronto, Canada. Dr. Beare’s e-mail address is mbeare@yorku.ca. This book features the work of eleven international scholars who were asked to examine the policing and politics that surround transnational crime, organized crime, money laundering and corruption. Most countries are under pressure to respond to such criminal challenges in a uniform manner in accordance with numerous international agreements, conventions, and guidelines; but some critics are concerned about what might be described as a gradual “Americanization” of international policing practices and policies 1
. They are especially concerned about the high priority placed on proceeds of crime and money laundering. This book emphasizes the significance of transnational crimes or organized criminal activity, the impact of illegal proceeds of crime upon specific markets, and the diverse forms of corruption they create. The various articles challenge some of the current political preoccupations with these issues and attempt to compare rhetoric with more empirically-based realities. Themes and Structure of the Book The book explores a number of common themes: the exploitable nature of taking organized crime as problem; the non-empirical basis for much of the media, police, and political responses; and the unintended consequences that can result from well-intentioned enforcement initiatives. Of additional interest are the policing and security industries that have grown up to “combat” organized crime and corruption, and whose livelihoods benefit from the high priority assigned to these forms of criminality. Contributing Authors Chapter One
on “Transnational Organized Crime: The Strange Career of an American Concept” is written by Michael Woodiwiss. 2
He provides us with a historical mapping of the American roots of our current understanding of what has become known as organized crime, and traces not only the antiquity of concern over organized crime but the distortion of our current focus. Power and politics have a determining influence on the definitions of ‘organized crime’ in the present international community. Chapter Two
by Tom Naylor, 3
is entitled “Predators, Parasites, or Free-market Pioneers: Reflections on the Nature and Analysis of Profit-Driven Crime”. It asks the reader to re-examine at a more micro-level the claims that are typically made about profit-driven crimes. He establishes three classifications of profit-driven crimes: predatory crimes for profit, which involve involuntary transfers; market-based exchanges in which illegal goods or services are sold for profit; and commercial exchanges which are the illegal production or illegal distribution of otherwise legal goods or services. Each of these categories of profit-driven crime has a different impact on society, and that impact is not always negative. Hence, societal responses, particularly those of law enforcement agencies, might be wise to differentiate rather than to group together all profit-driven criminal activity under the heading of “organized crime”. Chapter Three,
“From National to Global, from Empirical to Legal: The Ambivalent Concept of Transnational Organized Crime”, is written by Valsimas Mitsilegas. 4
His chapter provides the current European interpretation of legislation in Italy, Germany, the United Kingdom, the European Union and the United Nations. He documents the vague, ill-defined national and organizational responses. His analysis outlines the emergence of the organized-crime offence at the global level, and examines anti-organized crime initiatives against a backdrop of fundamental legal principles, thereby revealing the negotiations and compromises that go into obtaining multi-jurisdictional agreements. Chapter Four, “The Business of Bribery: Globalization, Economic Liberalization, and the ‘Problem’ of Corruption”, is written by James Williams 5
and Margaret Beare, 6
and takes on the issue of transparency. The chapter examines the role of the World Bank, International Monetary Fund and other international organizations such as Transparency International in packaging the current focus on one specific form of corruption, namely that which hinders the economies of the more developed countries. The chapter traces the growing response of international communities to corruption, and argues that globalization has created new political and economic spaces that are being largely filled by initiatives that conform to an economic logic defined by the developed world. International organizations that appear to have separate voices are all reading from the same script: a script that supports global business and finance. Chapter Five
is entitled “Against Transnational Organized Crime, and is written by James Sheptycki. 7
It examines the language that has grown around the activities subsumed under “transnational organized crime”. Sheptycki describes the veil being drawn over police work as policing becomes increasingly international and takes on a new rhetoric of transnational organized crime. The police apparatus now includes security forces and elite squads operating according to diverse international standards. In this new order, traditional accountability mechanisms are no longer adequate. The hard-won advances towards visibility in domestic policing are undermined by the call for all-out war against transnational organized crime. Chapter Six
by Kyle Grayson 8
on “Discourse, Identity, and the US ‘War on Drugs’”, analyses from a Foucaultian perspective the foreign policies of the United States against drug trafficking. He examines the rhetoric of both the “war on drugs” and the “security-threat” that has succeeded in merging drugs with the traditional discourses of transnational crime. His objective in this chapter is to understand both the reasons why the United States has chosen to link drugs with security and the methods by which this linkage has been made. Chapter Seven
on ‘Global Markets and Crime”, is written by Vincenzo Ruggiero. 9
It presents case materials that illustrate the role of ‘legitimate’ professionals in facilitating many ‘transnational’ crimes. He argues that white-collar crime and organized crime are increasingly blurred within the international cross-jurisdictional criminal environment. Vincenzo Ruggiero emphasizes the close links between legitimate business and illegitimate operations and argues that forms of social control help to determine the forms that crime will take. He sees “globalization” changing social control mechanisms, in turn causing changes in criminal activity. One result is an increasingly blurred relationship between the concepts of white-collar crime and organized crime. Cases are presented that illustrate the role of corporations and other ‘legitimate’ segments of society in supporting or facilitating criminal activity. After these somewhat theoretical papers, the remaining four chapters examine more concrete law enforcement issues. In Chapter eight, “Organized Corporate Criminality: Corporate Complicity in Tobacco Smuggling”, Margaret Beare examines in detail one example of a white-collar-organized crime. The tobacco industry has been shown to have operated in identical ways to more traditional notions of organized criminals: actively engaged in smuggling, fraud, money laundering and violence. The revelations concerning the tobacco corporations lead us to question why they have avoided being labelled criminal for so long. While some of their immunity relates to the general difficulty with proving white-collar crime, other equally valid reasons relate to the power of the corporations, and the limited range of people to whom we apply the term “organized criminal” or, for that, matter apply the criminal law. Chapter Nine, “The War on Drugs and the Military: The Case of Colombia”, by Juan Gabriel Ronderos, 10
challenges the rhetoric of the “war” on drugs, and law-enforcement responses arising from the foreign policies that underlie the rhetoric. He examines the consequences of such policies and law enforcement on a country such as Colombia, and shows the unintended consequences of misdirected enforcement strategies or misguided priorities. Chapter Ten
is entitled “Drug Trafficking and Organized Crime in Canada: A Study of High-level Drug Networks” ad is written by Fred Desroches. 11
He demonstrates empirically that the popular rhetoric about so-called “high-level drug traffickers” is largely false. His study 12
is part of a growing body of empirical research suggesting that even high-level drug traffickers come in many different types and that the members of a network engage in many different working arrangements among its members. The key finding is that the majority of traffickers are individual entrepreneurs who could quit, aspire to move up in the illicit occupational chain, or change and work with the competition. His study, based on interviews with high-level drug traffickers in prisons across Canada, dispels some of the myths about these criminals and their relationship to the larger entity collectively termed “organized crime”. If these criminals are not as imagined, perhaps other unverified assumptions about organized criminal groups should be questioned. Chapter Eleven
brings the book to an end with “Follow-the-Money Methods in Crime Control Policy”, a second chapter by Tom Naylor. It was written specifically for the Nathanson Centre for the Study of Organized Crime and Corruption on discusses the inherent fallacies of enforcement strategies directed against money laundering and proceeds of crime. Naylor examines forfeiture laws and the prime international policing strategy of going after illicit money. He challenges the assumptions upon which the prioritizing of anti-money laundering initiatives is based and suggests alternative approaches.

CHINESE TRANSNATIONAL ORGANIZED CRIME: THE FUK CHING
by James O. Finckenauer, Ph.D. International Center National Institute of Justice Organizational Structure
The organizational structure of Chinese organized crime in the United States is quite complex. Broadly defined, there is a great variety of Chinese criminal organizations. These include gangs, secret societies, triads, tongs, Taiwanese organized crime groups, and strictly US-based tongs and gangs. According to Ko-lin Chin, the foremost academic expert in the U.S. on Chinese organized crime, there is no empirical support for the belief that there is a well-organized, monolithic, hierarchical criminal cartel called the ?Chinese Mafia.? Chin says: ?My findings...do not support the notion that a chain of command exists among these various crime groups or that they coordinate with one another routinely in international crimes such as heroin trafficking, money laundering, and the smuggling of aliens? (1996:123). In order to simplify and focus our discussion, this analysis will concentrate on the Fuk Ching gang. The Fuk Ching are active in New York City, and are regarded as one of the most powerful, and also transnationally active, Chinese organized crime groups in the U.S. (Chin, 1996). They are estimated to have approximately 35 members, with another 20 members currently in prison. Other major gangs in New York City include the Ghost Shadows, Flying Dragons, Tung On, and Born-to-Kill. The New York City gangs, like the Fuk Ching, mainly operate extortion and protection rackets in defined neighborhoods in New York?s Chinatown. Their victims are mostly businesses in Chinatown. In California, the Chinese organized crime presence and problem is quite different from that in New York. In California, the dominant groups are the Wo Hop To and the the Wah Ching. One of the structural characteristics that makes Chinese organized crime different from other forms is the relationship between some of the street gangs and certain adult organizations. The latter are called tongs. The Fuk Ching, for example, are affiliated with the Fukien American Association. The Fukien American Association ? as with other tongs and their relationships with gangs ? provide the Fuk Ching with a physical place to gather and hang out. They allow the gang to operate on their (the tong?s) territory, thus legitimizing them with the community. They also provide criminal opportunities (such as protecting gambling operations), as well as supplying money and guns. The Fuk Ching originally emerged in New York in the mid-1980s, and as with other gangs, their main criminal activity in Chinatown was extortion. They were founded by a collection of young men (youth in their late teens and early twenties) from Fujian province in China -- many if not all of whom had criminal records in China. Fuk Ching recruitment today continues to be among Fujianese teenagers. Tong-affiliated gangs, like the Fuk Ching, have an ah kung (grandfather) or shuk foo (uncle) who is their tong leader. The top gang position is the dai dai lo (big big brother). Communicationbetween the tong and the gang occurs principally between these two individuals. Below the dai dai lo in descending order are the dai lo(s) or big brothers, the yee lo/saam lo (clique leaders), and at the bottom the ma jai or little horses. There are a variety of norms and rules that govern the gangs. These include respecting the ah kung, beating up members of other gangs on your turf, not using drugs, following the orders of the dai lo, and not betraying the gang. Rules violators are punished, sometimes severely, such as through physical assault and killing. Violence
Our research and our interviews with various experts confirms that violence is a defining characteristic of Chinese criminal gangs. Use of violence within the group and against other organized crime groups is very prevalent. Disputes over territory and criminal markets among the gangs are typically resolved using kong so, a process of peaceful negotiation. When this does not occur, however, the resolution is usually a violent one, in which guns are used against rival gang members. Law enforcement authorities believe that an escalation of gang violence has taken place in recent years, due in part to the advent of the Fuk Ching, and to gang involvement in alien smuggling activities. Based on his research, Chin concludes the following with respect to Chinese gang violence in general: The capacity for violence appears to be one of the key defining characteristics of street gang culture. Its employment, however, is shaped and determined by a cluster of constraints related to profit-generating goals. Violence between and among gangs is regulated through an agent or ah kung who attempts to channel aggressive behavior in ways that effectively maintain gang coherence. Gang coherence in turn supports the gang?s involvement in extortion activities and in the provision of protection services to organized vice industries in the community (Chin, 1996:138). The Fuk Ching are violent, but their use of violence is not very sophisticated nor specialized. It is not the systematic use of violence (including threats) to protect and gain monopoly control of criminal markets that is associated with mature forms of organized crime. Instead it is more likely to be random street level violence, with guns, employed by anyone in the gang. Sometimes this violence is sanctioned and sometimes not. Economic Resources
Understanding alien smuggling to be the illegal movement of migrants across national borders, and human trafficking to be migrant smuggling that includes coercion and exploitation, the Fuk Ching are extensively involved in both types of activities. Indeed, these criminal activities, along with kidnapping, are the main transnational crimes of the Fuk Ching. Their dominance is related to Fujian Province being the principal source of Chinese being smuggled and trafficked into North America. On the domestic scene, their main criminal activities in New York City?s Chinatown are extortion and gambling. Each Chinese gang dominates these crimes in theirparticular Chinatown neighborhoods. This includes the Fuk Ching. The professionalism and sophistication of the Fuk Ching are quite low, again as compared to more mature forms of organized crime. The same is true of other Chinese criminal gangs operating in the United States. This may be due to their being generally much younger than, for example, LCN or Russian organized crime figures. Also, their criminal activities are not particularly sophisticated, although the Fuk Ching may be becoming more complex in their organizational structure as they become more heavily engaged in human trafficking. In his research, Chin (1996) found that Chinese gangs were quite active in legitimate businesses in New York City?s Chinatown. For example, they owned or operated restaurants, retail stores, vegetable stands, car services, ice cream parlors, fish markets, and video stores. On a higher, more professional level, they also owned or operated wholesale supply firms, factories, banks, and employment agencies. In addition, on the West Coast Chinese gangs are believed to have penetrated the entertainment industry. Perhaps it is because of their relatively small size, the youth of their members, their lack of business experience and acumen, and the geographical constraints in which they operate, that Chinese gangs such as the Fuk Ching do not seem to play significant roles in the broader legitimate economy. Political Resources
The expert consensus is that the Fuk Ching, like other Chinese gangs, do not have the connections and stature to make them capable of corrupting U.S. police and judges. There have been only one or two cases of police corruption (none in recent years), and no cases of judicial corruption. As to political influence, there is some ability to manipulate the political system via corruption in China ? namely in Fujian Province and with respect to their human trafficking enterprise. In the United States, however, there is no evidence of corrupting the political process, of getting members elected or appointed to political office, nor of being able to manage media coverage of their activities. They are influential only in Chinatown, and their connections to U.S. politicians are non-existent. Any political influence Chinese gangs have is exerted through the tongs with which they are affiliated. For example, it is reported that the head of the Fukien American Association once gave $6,500 to a New York City Mayor?s re-election campaign (Kleinknecht, 1996:168). That the affiliation is not only beneficial to the gangs is evidenced in Chin?s report that tongs and other Chinatown community organizations benefit from the Chinese gangs? threats of extortion because business owners donate money to the associations in the belief that this will buy protection (1996). There is no evidence that Chinese gangs are involved with political terrorism either abroad or at home. Nor that they are associated with armed political groups of any kind. Response of Law Enforcement
The New York City Police Department (NYPD), which polices the neighborhood in which the Fuk Ching are active, uses all the standard law enforcement practices commonly used to combat organized crime. These include informants, undercover investigators, and electronic surveillance. In addition, both the police and the FBI support and encourage extortion victims to use hot lines to report their victimization. The NYPD has also created an Asian Gang Intelligence Unit that employs street patrols to monitor street gangs. Of the 15 Chinese crime groups indicted under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) between 1985 and 1994, one involved the Fuk Ching. In that 1993 case, 20 defendants were charged with, and pled guilty to murder. The investigation was conducted jointly by the FBI and the NYPD. On the international level, U.S. law enforcement has undertaken a number of initiatives to improve international cooperation against Chinese organized crime groups. These include the creation of the International Law Enforcement Academy (ILEA) in Bangkok, Thailand, and sponsorship of numerous international meetings on Asian organized crime. Annual meetings of the International Asian Organized Crime Conference attract more than a thousand law enforcement officials from dozens of countries. Both the ILEA and the conferences promote interaction among officials of affected countries, and lead to better cooperation and better information. Ko-lin Chin concludes that many crimes in Chinese-American communities ? especially drug trafficking, money laundering, and human trafficking ? are linked to China. He says that Chinese gang members flee to China when sought by American law enforcement. He recommends that ?deportation, extradition, joint operations, and intelligence sharing among law enforcement authorities from various countries...be carried out routinely....extradition treaties...be instated....[and that] U.S. authorities...be more culturally sensitive in dealing with foreign law enforcement agencies? (Chin, 1996:187). The External Environment
There is not general cultural acceptance of Chinese gangs such as the Fuk Ching in Chinatown. Most Chinese business owners comply with gang extortion demands because compliance is easier and less risky than resistance. As previously indicated, the gang affiliation with a tong gives them a degree of acceptability in the neighborhoods associated with that particular tong. The gang must be tolerated in order to gain any benefit that accrues from the tong. It would seem that there is little need in Chinatown for awareness raising campaigns on organized crime, or for sensitizing citizens on the dangers and threats posed by Chinese gangs. The Chinese who live in these neighborhoods are fully aware and fully sensitized. Rather than public information campaigns, Chinese businessmen would prefer a tougher criminal justice system. As Chin reports, ?they [Chinese businessmen] would like to see harsher punishment for offenders, the reinstitution of the death penalty..., and the deportation of chronic Chinese criminals? (1996:98). They also want to see many more Chinese police officers in theirneighborhoods. Because of the compartmentalized nature of Chinese organized crime in the United States, the public at large is little aware of and little concerned about what is going on in Chinatowns in U.S. cities. National media pay relatively little attention to these problems. For example, an Internet search of major U.S. newspapers under the topic ?Asian organized crime? for the period January 1, 1998 - August 1, 2000 produced only 13 articles. Chinese involvement in human smuggling, however, may be the exception to this rule. Chinese human smuggling has received considerable attention. A recent conference in Washington, DC on human smuggling pointed to five possible reasons for the high public profile given Chinese smuggling operations: (1) they are expensive; (2) associated human rights abuses are considerable; (3) they are highly efficient; (4) there is an enormous potential pool of migrants; and (5) collecting intelligence and other information from China is extraordinarily difficult (Conference Report, Transatlantic Workshop on Human Smuggling, 2000). Human trafficking activities by Chinese gangs such as the Fuk Ching are contributing to this higher profile. REFERENCES

WASHINGTON (AFP) Tuesday April 26, 2005
The
Hubble
Space
Telescope
turned 15,
with
750,000 photographs of deep space
and Earth to its credit, but its future is now uncertain. Hubble
was launched by the
Space
Shuttle Discovery on April 25, 1990, and opened a new era in astronomy. However, the
telescope, a cooperative effort of NASA and the
European Space
Agency, would not be operational until three years later. [The Hubble Space Telescope]

Enlarge The Hubble Space Telescope
A mirror that had been improperly ground was corrected in 1993, when a new camera was also installed in the
first repair mission by a space
shuttle. Once repaired, the
telescope
beamed back photographs 10 times sharper than ever before of galaxies, supernovas, giant explosions marking the
death of a star and the
birth of a black hole. Thanks to Hubble, flying above the
atmospheric distortion that hinders even more powerful Earth-based telescopes, scientists have been able to confirm that the
universe is rapidly expanding and to calculate precisely its age, at 13.7 billion years, according to NASA. Among other achievements, Hubble's observations allowed scientists to confirm the
existence of a strange form of energy called dark energy; proved the
existence of super-massive black holes; provided sharp views of a comet hitting Jupiter; and showed that the
process of forming planetary systems is common throughout the
galaxy, NASA said in a statement. NASA has so far decided not to send a shuttle to repair the
aging Hubble, citing the
450 million dollars it would cost to do so. But the
space
agency's new chief, Michael Griffin, has said he would revisit the
decision. Astronauts have serviced Hubble
four times, and many scientists hoped that a fifth service mission would be funded to enable Hubble
to function to 2011, when its infrared replacement, the
James Webb Space
Telescope, is scheduled to arrive. Currently, it is believed that Hubble's aging solar cells will provide enough energy to survive to 2007.   Hubble Space Telescope turns 15, with a galaxy of achievements

A White House decision to cut funding for a Hubble Space Telescope servicing mission and dump the observatory into a remote stretch of ocean waters at a future date is sure to incite debate in scientific, engineering, and policy making circles. Intensive work has been underway at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center to develop telerobotic servicing skills for the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) in the event that a space shuttle crew is never again sent to the orbiting facility. Aerospace firms in the United States and in Canada have teamed with NASA to develop a Hubble Robotic Vehicle Deorbit Module. Either a robotic or shuttle-based servicing option reportedly would cost in excess of $1 billion. That pricetag is viewed by the White House, according to sources, as not affordable given other high-priority and more expensive efforts, such as the return-to-flight of the space shuttle program, as well as moving forward on NASA’s Moon, Mars and beyond agenda. White House plans to scuttle Hubble is part of NASA’s 2006 budget request, sources said, with some money in the budget allocated to using a propulsion module coupled to Hubble for its safe but destructive deorbiting. The cutting of the HST servicing mission from NASA’s 2006 budget request was first reported
by Space News
on its website Friday and on  SPACE.com
. Leading the fight Senator Barbara Mikulski (D-Md.), a fervent Hubble supporter whose state is home to both the Goddard Space Flight Center and the Space Telescope Science Institute, issued a statement late January 21 in which she vowed to continue advocating an HST servicing mission. "It is essential that we have a safe and reliable servicing mission to Hubble," Mikulski said, that is consistent with the findings of the Columbia Accident Investigation Board and last month’s findings of a National Academy of Sciences (NAS) panel on the Hubble issue. On December 8, in the NAS final report released by the Committee on the Assessment of Options for Extending the Life of the Hubble Space Telescope, a blue ribbon group of experts said that NASA should reinstate a space shuttle mission to refurbish the Earth-orbiting telescope. "I led the fight to add $300 million to NASA’s budget last year for a Hubble servicing mission, and I plan to lead the fight again this year. This is what the American people expect and deserve," Mikulski said in a statement.  In defense of Hubble Response to the White House decision has engendered a wait-and-see attitude in some astronomical quarters, while others have been quick to react. Hubble’s best days lie ahead, predicted John Bahcall, a professor of natural sciences at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey. In 1998, he was a recipient of the National Medal of Science for his pioneering efforts in neutrino astrophysics and his contributions to the development and planning of the Hubble Space Telescope. "President Nixon cancelled in 1973 the Hubble Telescope while it was still in the development phase. The reason was similar: other activities in the NASA budget took priority," Bahcall told SPACE.com. "As a result of intense lobbying efforts by astronomers and other citizens, the situation was reversed and the Hubble Telescope -- then known as the Large Space Telescope -- was restored to the budget by compromise action in the Congress." Bahcall said that Hubble has contributed enormously to scientific knowledge and to America’s respect abroad. The telescope represents achievements of which all Americans can be proud, he said. "I am confident that Americans of all walks of life will come to the defense of the Hubble and cause the Congress to restore the repair of the telescope to the NASA budget," Bahcall said. Telerobotic progress Excellent progress is being made on a telerobotic approach to servicing the Hubble, said Jim Crocker, vice president of civil space at Lockheed Martin Space Systems of Denver. The firm has supported NASA’s planning and then repair and servicing of the HST via four space shuttle missions to date. The telerobotics team at work at Goddard Space Flight Center "have a good shot at pulling this off," Crocker told SPACE.com
the day before the Space News
story on the White House HST decision appeared. Lockheed Martin’s role in the rocket-launched Hubble Robotic Vehicle Deorbit Module (HRVDM), Crocker said, is providing all the sensors to do the rendezvous and docking with the Hubble, as well as provide the liquid-fueled propellant module that would later deorbit the telescope. For their part, Canada’s MacDonald, Dettwiler and Associates (MDA) Ltd. -- through its MD Robotics group in Brampton, Ontario -- is providing the Dextre robot that’s part of the HRVDM. It is being specially configured to replace batteries, gyroscopes, and perhaps an instrument on the HST to extend its life. NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center is overseeing and integrating the HRVDM work. Crocker said that simulations performed at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight center have converted doubters, including him, that performing many of the scheduled Hubble servicing tasks through the tender loving care of telerobotics is feasible. "That’s not to say it’s not challenging," Crocker said, "but the team is making a convincing story." Rabbit out of the hat There’s also good news to report in keeping Hubble in an operating mode. Worry centers on HST’s gyroscopes, batteries, or other gear that might fail early, negating the observatory’s useful lifetime. "The team continues to pull rabbits out of the hat," Crocker said. For instance, a two gyro science mode, along with the needed software has been worked out. HST’s original design had to have three gyros working to do science. Additionally, a new battery management approach is being adopted. "That’s good news," Crocker said. "I’m hearing we’re likely to be able to get [HST] into 2008 now." At the end of the day, Crocker concluded, whatever option is decided upon for Hubble servicing and its ultimate reentry, "everyone on the team wants the best chance of success possible."    Sponsored Links

TREC-8 Interactive Track Guidelines
TREC-8 Interactive Track Guidelines Goal  ----  The high-level goal of the Interactive Track in TREC-8 remains the investigation of searching as an interactive task by examining the process as well as the outcome. To this end a experimental framework has been designed with the following common features:         - an interactive search task         - 6 topics         - a document collection to be searched         - a required set of searcher (demographics) questionnaires         - 6 classes of data to be collected at each site and submitted to NIST         - 3 summary measures to be calculated by NIST for use by participants The framework will allow groups to estimate the effect of their experimental manipulation free and clear of the main (additive) effects of participant and topic and it will reduce the effect of interactions. In TREC-8 the emphasis will be on each group's exploration of different approaches to supporting the common searcher task and understanding the reasons for the results they get. No formal coordination of hypotheses or comparison of systems across sites is planned for TREC-8, but groups are encouraged to seek out and exploit synergies. As a first step, groups are strongly encouraged to make the focus of their planned investigations known to other track participants as soon as possible, preferably via the track listserv at trec-int@ohsu.edu.  Contact track chair Bill Hersh
to join. General Description  -------------------  A minimum of 12 participating searchers, one experimental system, and one control system per site will be required.  The control system can be any IR system appropriate to the goals of the local experiment, e.g. a variant of the local experimental system, some other baseline system such as SMART, ZPRISE, etc.  (See "2. Augmentation" in the detailed experimental design for information about how to use more than eight searchers or more than one experimental system within this design.) Each searcher will perform six searches on the Financial Times of London 1991-1994 collection (part of the TREC-8 adhoc collection), using six topics especially chosen from the TREC-8 adhoc topics and modified for use in the interactive track.  Each searcher will perform half of the total number of searches on the site's experimental system and the other half on its control system.  The experimental design (see below) determines the order in which each searcher performs the query and uses the systems (experimental and control). In resolving experimental design questions not covered here (e.g., scheduling of tutorials and searches, etc.), participating sites should try to minimize the differences between the conditions under which a given searcher uses the control and those under which s/he uses the experimental system. For example, running all the control searches for a participant on one day and the searches on the experimental system on another invites unequal, confounding conditions. Topics ------ Each of the topics will describe a need for information of a particular type. Contained within the documents of the collection to be searched will be multiple distinct examples or instances of the needed information. The interactive topics will be modified versions of specially selected adhoc topics. Here is an example TREC-6 adhoc topic:         Number: 303          Title: Hubble Telescope Achievements          Description:          Identify positive accomplishments of the Hubble telescope          since it was launched in 1991.         Narrative:          Documents are relevant that show the Hubble telescope has          produced new data, better quality data than previously          available, data that has increased human knowledge of the          universe, or data that has led to disproving previously          existing theories or hypotheses.  Documents limited to the          shortcomings of the telescope would be irrelevant.  Details          of repairs or modifications to the telescope without          reference to positive achievements would not be relevant. Here is an example of the same topic as it would be modified for use in the TREC-8 interactive track. Note the addition of the "Please save" paragraph and the removal of the usual Narrative section with its specific criteria for relevance or non-relevance:         Number: 303i          Title: Hubble Telescope Achievements          Description:          Identify positive accomplishments of the Hubble telescope          since it was launched in 1991.         Instances:         In the time alloted, please find as many DIFFERENT positive          accomplishments of the sort described above as you can.         Please save at least one document for EACH such DIFFERENT          accomplishment.         If one document discusses several such accomplishments, then          you need not save other documents that repeat those, since your          goal is to identify as many DIFFERENT accomplishments of the sort          described above as possible. Here are the topics for TREC-8 in NUMERICAL order. See the section "Experimental design for a site" below for their assignment to blocks and the order of presentation within the experimental design. Number: 408i Title: tropical storms Description: What tropical storms (hurricanes and typhoons) have caused property damage and/or loss of life? Instances: In the time alloted, please find as many DIFFERENT storms of the sort described above as you can. Please save at least one document for EACH such DIFFERENT storm. If one document discusses several such storms, then you need not save other documents that repeat those, since your goal is to identify as many DIFFERENT storms of the sort described above as possible. Number: 414i Title: Cuba, sugar, imports Description: What countries import Cuban sugar? Instances: In the time alloted, please find as many DIFFERENT countries of the sort described above as you can. Please save at least one document for EACH such DIFFERENT country. If one document discusses several such countries, then you need not save other documents that repeat those, since your goal is to identify as many DIFFERENT countries of the sort described above as possible. Number: 428i Title: declining birth rates Description: What countries other than the US and China have or have had a declining birth rate? Instances: In the time alloted, please find as many DIFFERENT countries of the sort described above as you can. Please save at least one document for EACH such DIFFERENT country. If one document discusses several such countries, then you need not save other documents that repeat those, since your goal is to identify as many DIFFERENT countries of the sort described above as possible. Number: 431i Title: robotic technology Description: What are the latest developments in robotic technology and in its use? Instances: In the time alloted, please find as many DIFFERENT developments of the sort described above as you can. Please save at least one document for EACH such DIFFERENT development. If one document discusses several such developments, then you need not save other documents that repeat those, since your goal is to identify as many DIFFERENT developments of the sort described above as possible. Number: 438i Title: tourism, increase Description: What countries have experienced an increase in tourism? Instances: In the time alloted, please find as many DIFFERENT countries of the sort described above as you can. Please save at least one document for EACH such DIFFERENT country. If one document discusses several such countries, then you need not save other documents that repeat those, since your goal is to identify as many DIFFERENT countries of the sort described above as possible. Number: 446i Title: tourists, violence Description: In what countries have tourists been subject to acts of violence causing bodily harm or death? Instances: In the time alloted, please find as many DIFFERENT countries of the sort described above as you can. Please save at least one document for EACH such DIFFERENT country. If one document discusses several such countries, then you need not save other documents that repeat those, since your goal is to identify as many DIFFERENT countries of the sort described above as possible. Searcher task ------------- The task of the interactive searcher is to save documents, which, taken together, contain as many different instances as possible of  the type of information the topic expresses a need for - within a 20 minute time limit. Searchers will be encouraged to avoid saving documents which contribute no instances beyond those in documents already saved, but there will be no scoring penalty for saving such documents and searchers will be told that. Instructions to be given to searchers ------------------------------------- The following introductory instructions are to be given once to each searcher before the first search:         "Imagine that you have just returned from a visit to your doctor          during which it was discovered that you are suffering from high         blood pressure. The doctor suggests that you take a new experimental         drug, but you wonder what alternative treatments are currently          available.  You decide to investigate the literature on your own         to satisfy your need for information about what different          alternatives are available to you for high blood pressure treatment.         You really need only one document for each of the different          treatments for high blood pressure.          You find and save a single document that lists four treatment drugs.         Then you find and save another two documents that each discusses a         separate alternative treatment: one that discusses the use of         calcium and one that talks about regular exercise.  You've run out          of time and stop your search. In all, you have identified six          different instances of alternative treatments in three documents.          ---         In this experiment, you will face a similar task. You will be          presented with several descriptions of needed information on a          number of topics. In each case there can be multiple examples or          instances of the type of information that's needed.         We would like you to identify as many different instances as you         can of the needed information for each topic that will be presented          to you -  as many as you can in the 20 minutes you will be given          to search.  Please save one document for EACH DIFFERENT instance          of the needed information that you identify. If you save one          document that contains several instances, try not to save additional         documents that contain ONLY those instances. However, you will not          be penalized if you save documents unnecessarily.           As you identify an instance of the needed information, please keep          track of which instances you have found: write down a word or short          phrase to identify the instance, or--if the system provides a          facility to keep track of instances--use it.                  Carefully read each topic to understand the type of information          needed. This will vary from topic to topic. On one topic you may be          looking for instances of a certain kind of event. On another you may          be searching for examples of certain sorts of people, places, or          things.         Do you have any questions about          - what we mean by instances of needed information          - the way in which you are to save nonredundant documents for each           instance?" Searcher questionnaires (minimum) ----------------------- Provided by Rutgers (see track web site) Data to be collected and submitted to NIST (emailed to over@nist.gov) ------------------------------------------ Several sorts of result data will be collected for evaluation/analysis (for all searches unless otherwise specified):    ===>  Due at NIST by 30. August 1999:         1. sparse format data       ===>  Due at NIST by when the site reports for the conference are due:         2. rich format data         3. a full narrative description of one interactive session for            whichever topic is designated as T1         4. any further guidance or refinement of the task specification            given to the searchers         5. data from the common searcher questionnaires Sparse format data for each search will comprise the list of documents saved and the elapsed clock time of the search. The searcher's selection (choice) of items for the final output list must be identified in terms of each document's TREC document identifier (DOCNO). The elapsed (clock) time in seconds taken for the search, from the time the searcher first sees the topic until s/he declares the search to be finished, should be recorded.  It is assumed that the interactive search takes place in one uninterrupted session.  If a session is unavoidably interrupted, it is recommended that it be abandoned and the topic given to another searcher.  Sparse format data will be the basis for the summary evaluation at NIST, which will produce a triple for each search: instance precision, instance recall, and elapsed clock time. Rich format data for each search will record: - the word or phrase each searcher records to describe each   instance s/he identifies (no reference to the containing document(s)) - significant events in the course of the interaction and their    timing.             Rich format data are intended for analytical evaluation by the            experimenters.             All significant events and their timing in the course of the            interaction should be recorded.  The events listed below are those            that seem to be fairly generally applicable to different systems            and interactive environments; however, the list may need extending            or modifying for specific systems and so should be taken as a            suggestion rather than a requirement:           o Intermediate search formulations:  if appropriate to the              system, these should be recorded.           o Documents viewed:  "viewing" is taken to mean the searcher              seeing a title or some other brief information about a              document; these events should be recorded.           o Documents seen:  "seeing" is taken to mean the searcher              seeing the text of a document, or a substantial section of              text; these events should be recorded.            o Terms entered by the searcher:  if appropriate to the              system, these should be recorded.           o Terms seen (offered by the system):  if appropriate to the              system, these should be recorded.           o Selection/rejection:  documents or terms selected by the              user for any further stage of the search (in addition to the              final selection of documents).  Format of sparse data to be submitted to NIST --------------------------------------------- TWO files from each site            A. Search file         Here a "search" is the interaction of a searcher given a topic         and asked to carry out the interactive search task using a given          system against the collection - lasting at most 20 minutes.         One line for EACH SEARCH, each line containing the          following blank-delimited items from left to right:                 1. Unique site ID                 2. Search ID  - site's choice (links search & document files)                 3. Searcher ID - site's choice                 4. System ID - site's choice                 5. TREC topic number                                          6. Elapsed time - number of secs., fractions truncated                    Clock time from the moment the searcher sees the                     topic until the moment the searcher indicates the                     search is complete or time is up.   B. Documents file         One line for each document in a given search result,         each line containing the following blank-delimited         items from left to right:                 1. Chronological sequence number ( "1", "2") within a search                    Use number of last time saved if saved multiple times.                          2. Search ID (from search file)                 3. TREC document identifier (DOCNO)              NOTE: Reported data items listed within each line must NOT          contain whitespace.      Format of other data to be submitted to NIST -------------------------------------------- Data other than that in sparse-format should be submitted as ASCII text files. The FA-1 score plus the questionaire data for each searcher should be  submitted in a separate file with format close to the following example but with the real responses to the right of the colons. The Tutorial Worksheet and Experimenter Note need not be submitted.         S i t e:         S e a r c h e r  I D:         FA-1 score:  ?         P r e - s e a r c h :                   (1 per searcher)         Searcher:       id         Condition:      ?         Degrees:        degree major date         Degrees:        degree major date         Degrees:        degree major date         Degrees:        degree major date         Degrees:        degree major date         Occupation:     ...         Gender:         M | F         Age:            nn         Previous TREC:  Y | N         Online searching: nn         Q1:             1-5         Q2:             1-5         Q3:             1-5         Q4:             1-5         Q5:             1-5         Q6:             1-5         Q7:             1-5         Q8:             1-5         S e a r c h :                           (8 per searcher)         Searcher:       id         Condition:      ?         Topic #:        nnn         Q1:             1-5         Q2:             1-5         Q3:             1-5         Q4:             1-5         Q5:             1-5         Q6:             1-5         P o s t - s y s t e m :                 (2 per searcher)         Searcher:       id         Condition:      ?         Q1:             1-5         Q2:             1-5         Q3:             1-5         Comments:       ...         S e a r c h e r   w o r k s h e e t :   (8 per searcher)         Searcher:       id         Condition:      ?         Topic #:        nnn         1.              ...         2.              ...         3.              ...         .         .         .                  E x i t :                               (1 per searcher)         Searcher        id         Q1:             1-5         Q2:             1-5         Q3:             1-5         Q4:             one-system's-name       rank                         other-system's-name     rank         Q5:             one-system's-name       rank                         other-system's-name     rank         Q6:             one-system's-name       rank                         other-system's-name     rank         Q7:             ...         Q8:             ...         Q9:             ... Evaluation of data submitted to NIST ------------------------------------ Evaluation by NIST of the sparse format data will proceed as follows. For each topic, a pool will be formed containing the unique documents saved by at least one searcher for that topic regardless of site. For each topic, the NIST assessor, normally the topic author, will be asked  to:         - read the topic carefully          - read each of the documents from the pool for that topic and            gradually:            - create a list of instances of the topic's needed information              type found somewhere in the documents            - select and record a short phrase describing each instance found            - determine which documents contain which instances            - bracket each instance in the text of the document in which it               was found For each search (by a given participant for a given topic at a given site),  NIST will use the submitted list of selected documents and the assessor's instance-document mapping for the topic to calculate:         - the fraction of total instances (as determined by the assessor) for            the topic that are covered by the submitted documents (i.e.,            instance recall)         - the fraction of the submitted documents which contain one or more           instances (i.e., instance precision)   The third measure, elapsed clock time, will be taken directly from the  submitted results for each search. Experimental design for a site ------------------------------   1. Minimal experimental matrix as run     The design for this year's track departs from last year's.  One limitation     of last year's balanced block design was the potential statistical     confouding of topic and its order.  A design that controls for query order     leads to a simpler statistical analysis of results.     As such, this year's approach will insure that each query is searched in     each position (first through sixth) by each system.  This requires a     minimum of 12 searchers per site.  In addition, the query orders for     each site will need to be generated in a pseudorandom fashion.  To make     this process consistent, the query orders will be generated by the OHSU     group.  Below is an example of system-query order for a site.  (NOTE:     Please do not use this example, as new sets must be generated for each     12-searcher block.)                  Subject       Block #1           Block #2                      1      System 1: 6-1-2    System 2: 3-4-5                      2      System 2: 1-2-3    System 1: 4-5-6                      3      System 2: 2-3-4    System 1: 5-6-1                      4      System 2: 3-4-5    System 1: 6-1-2                      5      System 1: 4-5-6    System 2: 1-2-3                      6      System 1: 5-6-1    System 2: 2-3-4                      7      System 2: 6-1-2    System 1: 3-4-5                      8      System 1: 1-2-3    System 2: 4-5-6                      9      System 1: 2-3-4    System 2: 5-6-1                     10      System 1: 3-4-5    System 2: 6-1-2                     11      System 2: 4-5-6    System 1: 1-2-3                     12      System 2: 5-6-1    System 1: 2-3-4     Query blocks should be requested from Bill Hersh
as early as possible.   2. Augmentation      The design for a given site can be augmented in two ways:        1. Participants can be added in groups of 6 using the design           above.  Additional blocks should be requested from Bill           Hersh.        2. Systems can be added by adding additional groups of 6 users           with each new system.  Additional blocks should be requested           Bill Hersh.      Topics cannot be added/subtracted individually for each site.       All augmentations other than the two listed above, however interesting,       are outside the scope of this design. If sites plan such adjunct       experiments, they are encouraged to design them for maximal synergy       with the track design.  3. Analysis      Up to each group, but all are strongly encouraged to take advantage      of the experimental design and undertake:         1. exploratory data analysis            to examine the patterns of correlation, interaction, etc.            involving the major factors. Some example plots for the TREC-6            interactive data (recall or precision by searcher or topic)            are available on the Interactive Track web site            <> under "Interactive Track History".                     2. analysis of variance (ANOVA), where appropriate,            to estimate the separate contributions of searcher, topic and             system as a first step in understanding why the results of one             search are different from those of another Last updated: Wednesday, 20-Aug-03 07:33:34 Date created: Monday, 31-Jul-00 For information about this webpage contact Paul Over

TREC-7 Interactive Track Guidelines
TREC-7 Interactive Track Guidelines Goal ---- The high-level goal of the Interactive Track in TREC-7 remains the investigation of searching as an interactive task by examining the process as well as the outcome. To this end a experimental framework has been designed with the following common features: - an interactive search task - 8 topics - a document collection to be searched - a required set of searcher (demographics) questionnaires - a required psychometric test for all searchers - 6 classes of data to be collected at each site and submitted to NIST - 3 summary measures to be calculated by NIST for use by participants The framework will allow groups to estimate the effect of their experimental manipulation free and clear of the main (additive) effects of participant and topic and it will reduce the effect of interactions. In TREC-7 the emphasis will be on each group's exploration of different approaches to supporting the common searcher task and understanding the reasons for the results they get. No formal coordination of hypotheses or comparison of systems across sites is planned for TREC-7, but groups are encouraged to seek out and exploit synergies. As a first step, groups are strongly encouraged to make the focus of their planned investigations known to other track participants as soon as possible. General Description ------------------- A minimum of eight participating searchers, one experimental system, and one control system per site will be required. The control system can be any IR system appropriate to the goals of the local experiment, e.g. a variant of the local experimental system, some other baseline system such as SMART, ZPRISE, etc. (See "2. Augmentation" in the detailed experimental design for information about how to use more than eight searchers or more than one experimental system within this design.) Each searcher will perform eight searches on the Financial Times of London 1991-1994 collection (part of the TREC-7 adhoc collection), using eight topics especially chosen from the TREC-7 adhoc topics and modified for use in the interactive track. Each searcher will perform half of the total number of searches on the site's experimental system and the other half on its control system. The detailed experimental design (see below) determines the order in which each searcher uses the systems (experimental and control). In resolving experimental design questions not covered here (e.g., scheduling of tutorials and searches, etc.), participating sites should try to minimize the differences between the conditions under which a given searcher uses the control and those under which s/he uses the experimental system. For example, running all the control searches for a participant on one day and the searches on the experimental system on another invites unequal, confounding conditions. Topics ------ Each of the topics will describe a need for information of a particular type. Contained within the documents of the collection to be searched will be multiple distinct examples or instances of the needed information. The interactive topics will be modified versions of specially selected adhoc topics. Here is an example TREC-6 adhoc topic: Number: 303i Title: Hubble Telescope Achievements Description: Identify positive accomplishments of the Hubble telescope since it was launched in 1991. Narrative: Documents are relevant that show the Hubble telescope has produced new data, better quality data than previously available, data that has increased human knowledge of the universe, or data that has led to disproving previously existing theories or hypotheses. Documents limited to the shortcomings of the telescope would be irrelevant. Details of repairs or modifications to the telescope without reference to positive achievements would not be relevant. Here is an example of the same topic as it would be modified for use in the TREC-7 interactive track. Note the addition of the "Please save" paragraph and the removal of the usual Narrative section with its specific criteria for relevance or non-relevance: Number: 303i Title: Hubble Telescope Achievements Description: Identify positive accomplishments of the Hubble telescope since it was launched in 1991. Instances: In the time alloted, please find as many DIFFERENT positive accomplishments of the sort described above as you can. Please save at least one document for EACH such DIFFERENT accomplishment. If one document discusses several such accomplishments, then you need not save other documents that repeat those, since your goal is to identify as many DIFFERENT accomplishments of the sort described above as possible. Here are the topics for TREC-7 in NUMERICAL order. See the section "Experimental design for a site" below for their assignment to blocks and the order of presentation within the experimental design. ------------------------------------------------------------------------- Number: 352i Title: British Chunnel impacts Description: Impacts of the Chunnel - anticipated or actual - on the British economy and/or the life style of the British Instances: In the time alloted, please find as many DIFFERENT impacts of the sort described above as you can.

If one document discusses several such applications, then you need not save other documents that repeat those, since your goal is to identify as many DIFFERENT applications of the sort described above as possible. ------------------------------------------------------------------------- Searcher task ------------- The task of the interactive searcher is to save documents, which, taken together, contain as many different instances as possible of the type of information the topic expresses a need for - within a 15 minute time limit. Searchers will be encouraged to avoid saving documents which contribute no instances beyond those in documents already saved, but there will be no scoring penalty for saving such documents and searchers will be told that. Instructions to be given to searchers ------------------------------------- The following introductory instructions are to be given once to each searcher before the first search: "Imagine that you have just returned from a visit to your doctor during which it was discovered that you are suffering from high blood pressure. The doctor suggests that you take a new experimental drug, but you wonder what alternative treatments are currently available. You decide to investigate the literature on your own to satisfy your need for information about what different alternatives are available to you for high blood pressure treatment. You really need only one document for each of the different treatments for high blood pressure. You find and save a single document that lists four treatment drugs. Then you find and save another two documents that each discusses a separate alternative treatment: one that discusses the use of calcium and one that talks about regular exercise. You've run out of time and stop your search. In all, you have identified six different instances of alternative treatments in three documents. --- In this experiment, you will face a similar task. You will be presented with several descriptions of needed information on a number of topics. In each case there can be multiple examples or instances of the type of information that's needed. We would like you to identify as many different instances as you can of the needed information for each topic that will be presented to you - as many as you can in the 15 minutes you will be given to search. Please save one document for EACH DIFFERENT instance of the needed information that you identify. If you save one document that contains several instances, try not to save additional documents that contain ONLY those instances. However, you will not be penalized if you save documents unnecessarily. As you identify an instance of the needed information, please keep track of which instances you have found: write down a word or short phrase to identify the instance, or--if the system provides a facility to keep track of instances--use it. Carefully read each topic to understand the type of information needed. This will vary from topic to topic. On one topic you may be looking for instances of a certain kind of event. On another you may be searching for examples of certain sorts of people, places, or things. Do you have any questions about - what we mean by instances of needed information - the way in which you are to save nonredundant documents for each instance?" Searcher questionnaires (minimum) ----------------------- Provided by Rutgers (see track web site) Psychometric test ----------------- - FA-1 (Controlled Associations) from ETS's "Kit of Reference Tests for Cognitive Factors" (1976 Edition) Data to be collected and submitted to NIST (emailed to over@nist.gov) ------------------------------------------ Several sorts of result data will be collected for evaluation/analysis (for all searches unless otherwise specified): ===> Due at NIST by 30. August 1998: 1. sparse format data ===> Due at NIST by end of the day (Washington,DC) on 27. October 1998: 2. rich format data 3. a full narrative description of one interactive session for whichever topic is designated as T1 4. any further guidance or refinement of the task specification given to the searchers 5. data from the common searcher questionnaires 6. results from the psychometric test (FA-1) given to all searchers Sparse format data for each search will comprise the list of documents saved and the elapsed clock time of the search. The searcher's selection (choice) of items for the final output list must be identified in terms of each document's TREC document identifier (DOCNO). The elapsed (clock) time in seconds taken for the search, from the time the searcher first sees the topic until s/he declares the search to be finished, should be recorded. It is assumed that the interactive search takes place in one uninterrupted session. If a session is unavoidably interrupted, it is recommended that it be abandoned and the topic given to another searcher. Sparse format data will be the basis for the summary evaluation at NIST, which will produce a triple for each search: instance precision, instance recall, and elapsed clock time. Rich format data for each search will record: - the word or phrase each searcher records to describe each instance s/he identifies (no reference to the containing document(s)) - significant events in the course of the interaction and their timing. Rich format data are intended for analytical evaluation by the experimenters. All significant events and their timing in the course of the interaction should be recorded. The events listed below are those that seem to be fairly generally applicable to different systems and interactive environments; however, the list may need extending or modifying for specific systems and so should be taken as a suggestion rather than a requirement: o Intermediate search formulations: if appropriate to the system, these should be recorded. o Documents viewed: "viewing" is taken to mean the searcher seeing a title or some other brief information about a document; these events should be recorded. o Documents seen: "seeing" is taken to mean the searcher seeing the text of a document, or a substantial section of text; these events should be recorded. o Terms entered by the searcher: if appropriate to the system, these should be recorded. o Terms seen (offered by the system): if appropriate to the system, these should be recorded. o Selection/rejection: documents or terms selected by the user for any further stage of the search (in addition to the final selection of documents). Format of sparse data to be submitted to NIST --------------------------------------------- TWO files from each site A. Search file Here a "search" is the interaction of a searcher given a topic and asked to carry out the interactive search task using a given system against the collection - lasting at most 20 minutes. One line for EACH SEARCH, each line containing the following blank-delimited items from left to right: 1. Unique site ID 2. Search ID - site's choice (links search & document files) 3. Searcher ID - site's choice 4. System ID - site's choice 5. TREC topic number 6. Elapsed time - number of secs., fractions truncated Clock time from the moment the searcher sees the topic until the moment the searcher indicates the search is complete or time is up. B. Documents file One line for each document in a given search result, each line containing the following blank-delimited items from left to right: 1. Chronological sequence number ( "1", "2") within a search Use number of last time saved if saved multiple times. 2. Search ID (from search file) 3. TREC document identifier (DOCNO) NOTE: Reported data items listed within each line must NOT contain whitespace. Format of other data to be submitted to NIST -------------------------------------------- Data other than that in sparse-format should be submitted as ASCII text files. The FA-1 score plus the questionaire data for each searcher should be submitted in a separate file with format close to the following example but with the real responses to the right of the colons. The Tutorial Worksheet and Experimenter Note need not be submitted. S i t e: S e a r c h e r I D: FA-1 score: ? P r e - s e a r c h : (1 per searcher) Searcher: id Condition: ?

Q8: ... Q9: ... Evaluation of data submitted to NIST ------------------------------------ Evaluation by NIST of the sparse format data will proceed as follows. For each topic, a pool will be formed containing the unique documents saved by at least one searcher for that topic regardless of site. For each topic, the NIST assessor, normally the topic author, will be asked to: - read the topic carefully - read each of the documents from the pool for that topic and gradually: - create a list of instances of the topic's needed information type found somewhere in the documents - select and record a short phrase describing each instance found - determine which documents contain which instances - bracket each instance in the text of the document in which it was found For each search (by a given participant for a given topic at a given site), NIST will use the submitted list of selected documents and the assessor's instance-document mapping for the topic to calculate: - the fraction of total instances (as determined by the assessor) for the topic that are covered by the submitted documents (i.e., instance recall) - the fraction of the submitted documents which contain one or more instances (i.e., instance precision) The third measure, elapsed clock time, will be taken directly from the submitted results for each search. Experimental design for a site ------------------------------ 1. Minimal experimental matrix as run Define two blocks of four topics each, order of presentation fixed within each block: B1 = T1 -> T2 -> T3 -> T4 365i 357i 362i 352i B2 = T5 -> T6 -> T7 -> T8 366i 392i 387i 353i Participants | System,Topic --------------+-------------------- P1 | E,B1 C,B2 P2 | C,B2 E,B1 P3 | E,B2 C,B1 P4 | C,B1 E,B2 P5 | E,B1 C,B2 P6 | C,B2 E,B1 P7 | E,B2 C,B1 P8 | C,B1 E,B2 or expanded to show the individual topics: Participants | System,Topic combinations --------------+--------------------------------------------------- P1 | E,T1 E,T2 E,T3 E,T4 C,T5 C,T6 C,T7 C,T8 P2 | C,T5 C,T6 C,T7 C,T8 E,T1 E,T2 E,T3 E,T4 P3 | E,T5 E,T6 E,T7 E,T8 C,T1 C,T2 C,T3 C,T4 P4 | C,T1 C,T2 C,T3 C,T4 E,T5 E,T6 E,T7 E,T8 P5 | E,T1 E,T2 E,T3 E,T4 C,T5 C,T6 C,T7 C,T8 P6 | C,T5 C,T6 C,T7 C,T8 E T1 E,T2 E,T3 E,T4 P7 | E,T5 E,T6 E,T7 E,T8 C,T1 C,T2 C,T3 C,T4 P8 | C,T1 C,T2 C,T3 C,T4 E,T5 E,T6 E,T7 E,T8 - E = experimental system - C = Control system - site's choice - The participants (searchers) should be numbered sequentially, 1, ..., J. J must be at least 8 (see part 4 below on how to add more) Each site will randomly assign participants to the rows of its design. The order for presentation of topics to searchers at all participating sites is defined by the above design. The assignment of actual topics to T1, T2, ... T8 will be determined by NIST in collaboration with the track shortly after the interactive topics are made available. For the purposes of analysis each 4-person-by-8-topic matrix defined above will in effect be rearranged by permuting the columns (topics) so E alternates with C as in the following: Participants | System,Topic combinations --------------+--------------------------------------------------- P1 | E,T1 C,T5 E,T2 C,T6 E,T3 C,T7 E,T4 C,T8 P2 | C,T5 E,T1 C,T6 E,T2 C,T7 E,T3 C,T8 E,T4 P3 | E,T5 C,T1 E,T6 C,T2 E,T7 C,T3 E,T8 C,T4 P4 | C,T1 E,T5 C,T2 E,T6 C,T3 E,T7 C,T4 E,T8 Note that this matrix consists of the following 2x2 subdesign: E C C E This 2x2 design is a latin square design. It has the property that the "treatment effect", here E-C, the control-adjusted response, can be estimated free and clear of the main (additive) effects of participant and topic. Here, participant and topic are treated statistically as blocking factors. This means that even in the presence of differences between participants and topics, which clearly are anticipated, the design will provide estimates of E-C that are not contaminated by these differences. However, the estimate of E-C is contaminated by the presence of an interaction between topic and participant. Therefore, we replicate the 2x2 latin square 4x4 times to get the minimal 8x8 design for each site. The contaminating effect of the topic by participant interaction is reduced by averaging the sixteen estimates of E-C that are available, one for each 2x2 latin square. This is analogous to averaging replicate measurements of a single quantity in order to reduce the measurement uncertainty. 2. Augmentation The design for a given site can be augmented in two ways: 1. Participants can be added by in groups of 4 using the design for P1-4 (above). 2. Systems can be added by repeating the 8x8 design with at least one new system. Topics cannot be added/subtracted individually for each site. All augmentations other than the two listed above, however interesting, are outside the scope of this design. If sites plan such adjunct experiments, they are encouraged to design them for maximal synergy with the track design. 3. Analysis Up to each group, but all are strongly encouraged to take advantage of the experimental design and undertake: 1. exploratory data analysis to examine the patterns of correlation, interaction, etc. involving the major factors. Some example plots for the TREC-6 interactive data (recall or precision by searcher or topic) are available on the Interactive Track web site at www-nlpir.nist.gov/~over/t7i under "Interactive Track History". 2. analysis of variance (ANOVA), where appropriate, to estimate the separate contributions of searcher, topic and system as a first step in understanding why the results of one search are different from those of another.

Hubble celebrates 15th anniversary with spectacular new images
  Whirlpool Galaxy M51
  25 April 2005
In the 15 years that the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope has orbited Earth, it has taken three-quarters of a million photographs of the cosmos. Two new views have been released of Hubble's most well-known images: the Whirlpool Galaxy, M51, and the Eagle Nebula, M16.   The new images released for Hubble’s 15th anniversary are among the largest and sharpest views Hubble has ever taken, and were made with Hubble's Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS). The new Whirlpool Galaxy image shows the spiral galaxy's classic features, from its curving arms, where newborn stars reside, to its yellowish central core that serves as home for older stars. The new Eagle Nebula image reveals a tall, dense tower of gas being sculpted by ultraviolet light from a group of massive, hot stars. NASA’s Space Shuttle Discovery launched Hubble into space on 24 April 1990 and placed it into orbit a day after, thereby opening a brand new era in astronomy. For the first time ever, a large telescope that viewed in visible light orbited above Earth's distorting atmosphere, which blurs starlight and make images appear fuzzy. After installation of a new camera and a device that compensated for an improperly ground mirror, images of planets, stars, galaxies, and nebula began pouring in – all up to 10 times sharper than any previous telescope had ever delivered.     Long list of scientific achievements
  During 15 years of viewing the sky, Hubble has taken more than 700000 exposures of more than 22 000 celestial objects. The spacecraft itself has whirled around Earth nearly 88 000 times, travelling more than 4000 million kilometres. The orbiting observatory generates enough data every day - about 15 gigabytes - to fill more than three DVDs, and in total it has produced 23 terabytes of data, equal to the amount of text in 23 million novels. Over 3900 astronomers from all over the world have used the telescope, and compiled a long list of scientific achievements, published in more than 4000 papers, such as: - calculating the precise age of the Universe to be 13 700 million years old); - confirming the existence of a strange form of energy called dark energy; - detecting small ‘proto-galaxies’ that emitted their light when the Universe was less than a 1000 million years old; - proving the existence of ‘super-massive black holes’; - seeing a comet hitting Jupiter; and - showing that the process of forming planetary systems is common throughout the galaxy.     The Whirlpool Galaxy
  The two winding arms of the majestic Whirlpool spiral galaxy M51 (NGC 5194) are actually long lanes of stars and gas laced with dust, a hallmark of so-called ‘grand-design’ spiral galaxies. Located 31 million light-years away in the constellation Canes Venatici (the Hunting Dogs), the Whirlpool's face-on view and closeness to Earth allow astronomers to study a classic spiral galaxy's structure and star-forming processes. Some astronomers believe that the Whirlpool's arms are so prominent because of the effects of a close encounter with NGC 5195, the small, yellowish galaxy at the outermost tip of one of the Whirlpool's arms. At first glance, the compact galaxy appears to be tugging on the arm. Hubble's clear view, however, shows that NGC 5195 is passing behind the Whirlpool. The small galaxy has been gliding past the Whirlpool for hundreds of millions of years.     Eagle Nebula M16
The Eagle Nebula
  A soaring tower of cold gas and dust about 9.5 light-years high, which is twice the distance from the Sun to our nearest star, rises from a stellar nursery called the Eagle Nebula, M16. Inside the gaseous tower, stars may be forming. Some of the stars may have been created by dense gas collapsing under gravity. Other stars may be forming due to pressure from gas that has been heated by the neighbouring hot stars. The tower's rough surface is illuminated by starlight and is silhouetted against the background glow of more distant gas. The colours in this image were produced by gas energised by the star cluster's powerful ultraviolet light. The blue colour at the top is from glowing oxygen and the red in the lower region is from glowing hydrogen.     Send this page to a friend       More about...

Hubble and the Messier objects
The Hubble Space Telescope and the Messier objects [hst.jpg]
The famous Hubble Space Telescope is certainly one of the most innovative tools of the astronomers in the 1990s decade; the present author is just now going to predict (and is convinced it deserves) that it might win the title "Photographer of the Decade" for the 1990, as Voyager 2 was nominated for the 1980. Its most spectacular results, together with an open and intelligent public relations policy of the Space Telescope Science Institute, has provided astronomers with a great flood of data and high-quality images, and an outstanding popularity, especially as all the materials get public domain two years after they were obtained. The Hubble results have revolutionized the state of knowledge in virtually any branch of astronomy -- not that every good result comes from the HST, but as these data are available publicly, they are used if ever possible; from planets, comets, and asteroids to stars, clusters, nebulae, and galaxies, every sort of objects in the sky were investigated, often obtaining most revolutionary results. Among the most outstanding achievements are observations of objects from Messier's catalog, as those are outstanding representatives of all types of Deep-Sky objects. Because not every author has made his results available to the public domain, we cannot present a comprehensive review here at the moment. But we have tried to link into our catalog some of the most interesting achievements. There's but one fact on the Hubble Telescope's optics which must be kept in mind: The Hubble telescope has a very long focal length of 190 feet (58 m), and thus a one degree field measures one full meter in the space telescope's focal plane, and one arc minute about 1.7 cm. As its detectors are very much smaller, their fields of view are actually small, so that only photos of small portions of extended objects like most of Messier's catalog can be obtained. Moreover, the Hubble Space Telescope is not only an astronomical instrument (though the telescope makes up its biggest part) but also a sophisticated spacecraft. As a spacecraft, it has proven to be very reliable, and was so well operated that the technological operations did virtually never concern the scientific program (at least up to November 1999 when it shut down itself because the fourth of 6 gyroscopes failed - only to be recovered in the third servicing mission, STS-103, in December 1999). The Hubble Space Telescope (HST) was originally projected under the name "Large Space Telescope" (LST) and then simply "Space Telescope" (ST), and developed since the 1970s. Indeed, Hubble is one of the more important in a considerably long list of orbiting telescopes, or astronomy satellites. It is the second of four in a NASA series of large orbiting observatories, observing in the visible light, together with the Compton Gamma Ray Telescope (CGRO) observing in Gamma-ray light, the Chandra X-ray Observatory (CXO), and the Spitzer Space Telescope (SST)
observing in Infrared. Here's a list of links to the Hubble observations of Messier objects we could collect with our pages: M1: Jeff Hester

[SpaceDaily Frontpage]
SPACE WIRE Hubble Space Telescope turns 15, with a galaxy of achievements WASHINGTON (AFP) Apr 26, 2005 The Hubble Space Telescope turned 15 Monday, with 750,000 photographs of deep space and Earth to its credit, but its future is now uncertain. Hubble was launched by the Space Shuttle Discovery on April 25, 1990, and opened a new era in astronomy. However, the telescope, a cooperative effort of NASA and the European Space Agency, would not be operational until three years later. A mirror that had been improperly ground was corrected in 1993, when a new camera was also installed in the first repair mission by a space shuttle. Once repaired, the telescope beamed back photographs 10 times sharper than ever before of galaxies, supernovas, giant explosions marking the death of a star and the birth of a black hole. Thanks to Hubble, flying above the atmospheric distortion that hinders even more powerful Earth-based telescopes, scientists have been able to confirm that the universe is rapidly expanding and to calculate precisely its age, at 13.7 billion years, according to NASA. Among other achievements, Hubble's observations allowed scientists to confirm the existence of a strange form of energy called dark energy; proved the existence of super-massive black holes; provided sharp views of a comet hitting Jupiter; and showed that the process of forming planetary systems is common throughout the galaxy, NASA said in a statement. NASA has so far decided not to send a shuttle to repair the aging Hubble, citing the 450 million dollars it would cost to do so. But the space agency's new chief, Michael Griffin, has said he would revisit the decision. Astronauts have serviced Hubble four times, and many scientists hoped that a fifth service mission would be funded to enable Hubble to function to 2011, when its infrared replacement, the James Webb Space Telescope, is scheduled to arrive. Currently, it is believed that Hubble's aging solar cells will provide enough energy to survive to 2007. All rights reserved. © 2005 Agence France-Presse.

By Leonard David, SPACE.com A White House decision to cut funding for a Hubble Space Telescope servicing mission and dump the observatory into a remote stretch of ocean waters at a future date is sure to incite debate in scientific, engineering, and policy making circles. The Hubble Space Telescope snaps a view of Senegal. The telescope is in need of service, which is not in the current NASA budget.
NASA/JSC
Intensive work has been underway at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center to develop telerobotic servicing skills for the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) in the event that a space shuttle crew is never again sent to the orbiting facility. Aerospace firms in the United States and in Canada have teamed with NASA to develop a Hubble Robotic Vehicle Deorbit Module. Either a robotic or shuttle-based servicing option reportedly would cost in excess of $1 billion. That pricetag is viewed by the White House, according to sources, as not affordable given other high-priority and more expensive efforts, such as the return-to-flight of the space shuttle program, as well as moving forward on NASA's Moon, Mars and beyond agenda. White House plans to scuttle Hubble is part of NASA's 2006 budget request, sources said, with some money in the budget allocated to using a propulsion module coupled to Hubble for its safe but destructive deorbiting. The cutting of the HST servicing mission from NASA's 2006 budget request was first reported by Space News on its Web site Friday and on SPACE.com. Leading the fight
Senator Barbara Mikulski (D-Md.), a fervent Hubble supporter whose state is home to both the Goddard Space Flight Center and the Space Telescope Science Institute, issued a statement late January 21 in which she vowed to continue advocating an HST servicing mission. "It is essential that we have a safe and reliable servicing mission to Hubble," Mikulski said, that is consistent with the findings of the Columbia Accident Investigation Board and last month's findings of a National Academy of Sciences (NAS) panel on the Hubble issue. On December 8, in the NAS final report released by the Committee on the Assessment of Options for Extending the Life of the Hubble Space Telescope, a blue ribbon group of experts said that NASA should reinstate a space shuttle mission to refurbish the Earth-orbiting telescope. "I led the fight to add $300 million to NASA's budget last year for a Hubble servicing mission, and I plan to lead the fight again this year. This is what the American people expect and deserve," Mikulski said in a statement. In defense of Hubble
Response to the White House decision has engendered a wait-and-see attitude in some astronomical quarters, while others have been quick to react. Hubble's best days lie ahead, predicted John Bahcall, a professor of natural sciences at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey. In 1998, he was a recipient of the National Medal of Science for his pioneering efforts in neutrino astrophysics and his contributions to the development and planning of the Hubble Space Telescope. "President Nixon cancelled in 1973 the Hubble Telescope while it was still in the development phase. The reason was similar: other activities in the NASA budget took priority," Bahcall told SPACE.com. "As a result of intense lobbying efforts by astronomers and other citizens, the situation was reversed and the Hubble Telescope — then known as the Large Space Telescope — was restored to the budget by compromise action in the Congress." Bahcall said that Hubble has contributed enormously to scientific knowledge and to America's respect abroad. The telescope represents achievements of which all Americans can be proud, he said. "I am confident that Americans of all walks of life will come to the defense of the Hubble and cause the Congress to restore the repair of the telescope to the NASA budget," Bahcall said. Telerobotic progress
Excellent progress is being made on a telerobotic approach to servicing the Hubble, said Jim Crocker, vice president of civil space at Lockheed Martin Space Systems of Denver. The firm has supported NASA's planning and then repair and servicing of the HST via four space shuttle missions to date. The telerobotics team at work at Goddard Space Flight Center "have a good shot at pulling this off," Crocker told SPACE.com the day before the Space News story on the White House HST decision appeared. Lockheed Martin's role in the rocket-launched Hubble Robotic Vehicle Deorbit Module (HRVDM), Crocker said, is providing all the sensors to do the rendezvous and docking with the Hubble, as well as provide the liquid-fueled propellant module that would later deorbit the telescope. For their part, Canada's MacDonald, Dettwiler and Associates (MDA) Ltd. — through its MD Robotics group in Brampton, Ontario — is providing the Dextre robot that's part of the HRVDM. It is being specially configured to replace batteries, gyroscopes, and perhaps an instrument on the HST to extend its life. NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center is overseeing and integrating the HRVDM work. Crocker said that simulations performed at NASA's Goddard Space Flight center have converted doubters, including him, that performing many of the scheduled Hubble servicing tasks through the tender loving care of telerobotics is feasible. "That's not to say it's not challenging," Crocker said, "but the team is making a convincing story." Rabbit out of the hat
There's also good news to report in keeping Hubble in an operating mode. Worry centers on HST's gyroscopes, batteries, or other gear that might fail early, negating the observatory's useful lifetime. "The team continues to pull rabbits out of the hat," Crocker said. For instance, a two gyro science mode, along with the needed software has been worked out. HST's original design had to have three gyros working to do science. Additionally, a new battery management approach is being adopted. "That's good news," Crocker said. "I'm hearing we're likely to be able to get [HST] into 2008 now." At the end of the day, Crocker concluded, whatever option is decided upon for Hubble servicing and its ultimate reentry, "everyone on the team wants the best chance of success possible."

The Hubble Space Telescope
by Jim Slotta Scientist
Telescopes have come a long way since the days of Galileo! Over the years, larger and larger telescopes were constructed in order to capture the light from more and more distant stars. Still, no matter how large a lens or mirror was used, there was always a problem with any telescope located on the surface of the earth, as the earth's atmosphere tends to block or absorb some of the starlight. Because the light from distant stars is very faint to begin with, this interference from the atmosphere became a serious problem as scientists looked further and further out into space. For decades, astronomers longed for a telescope that was free from the earth's atmospheric blockade -- on the surface of the moon, perhaps, or in orbit around the earth as a satellite. In 1993, they were finally rewarded, as NASA engineers delivered the orbiting Hubble Space Telescope: (Medium, 57K)
Originally, the giant light-collecting mirror of the Hubble was slightly out of shape, which meant that the images of far-off stars were out of focus. But when space shuttle astronauts repaired this problem in December of 1993, a whole new chapter in the book of astronomy had begun. One newspaper reporter wrote: "The Hubble Space Telescope, once blurry and the butt of jokes, has been repaired, making it sharp enough to see two fireflies 10 feet apart in Tokyo from Washington DC. It is sensitive enough to detect their individual flashes." --The San Fransisco Examiner
The Hubble can look at galaxies which are very old as described in an article from Philadelphia's daily newspaper, the Philadelphia Inquirer.: "...scientists announced they had pictures of galaxies so distant that the light from them had taken billions of years to reach Hubble's cameras. The telescope was therefore seeing how the galaxies looked when they were young-it was watching the past unfold." --The Philadelphia Inquirer
(Check out the Philadelphia Inquirer article to learn all about the Hubble telescope, including some of its major successes as a scientific instrument.) Evidence Information KEYWORDS Telescope, Hubble, Light, Space, Astronomy SUBMITTER Philip Bell Additional Information METHODS The evidence combines NASA photos of the Hubble with a quote from a newspaper and an informative article about the Hubble telescope's history and various achievements. This informative article, written by a Philadelphia Inquirer reporter, contains some interesting links to other related Web sites. INSPIRATION This evidence about the Hubble Space Telescope was assembled in order to provide some information about the problems with conventional telescopes and how they have been overcome. PROJECTS How Far Does Light Go? GUIDANCE - Why does the fact that the Hubble is outside of the Earth's atmosphere make a difference in what it allows us to see? - Does the fact that the Hubble can see light from galaxies which has traveled in space for billions of years support either theory in the debate? - How far away can the Hubble see stars? What does that say about the light coming from these stars? - The article tells us that the Hubble has allowed astronomers to learn more about distant galaxies. Why does it say the Hubble was seeing the galaxies as they appeared when they were very young? - Could a telescope on the earth's surface with a really huge and precise mirror or lens detect the things the Hubble is detecting? Why or why not? COMPREHENSION TIME 5 to 20 minutes SCIENCE LEVEL Middle School and Above KIE Evidence. Copyright © 1996-7 The KIE Group.

Insurance Group Names Most Dangerous Vehicles 03.16.2005
By James M. Flammang
According to the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety
(IIHS), a version of the Chevrolet Blazer
may be the most unsafe vehicle to be found on American roads. Based on the Institute's study of 1999-2002 passenger vehicles, the two-door, two-wheel-drive Blazer had the highest rate of driver deaths, in both single-vehicle and multiple-vehicle accidents. While the average annual driver death rate was 87 per million registered vehicles, the two-door Blazer averaged 308 deaths per million. Rollover accidents also topped the list of 199 vehicle models, at 251 per million. Models with the highest death rates are "mostly small cars and mid-sized SUVs," the Institute asserted. The list of vehicles with high rates also included the Mitsubishi Mirage
two-door sedan, with 209 driver deaths per million vehicles, followed by the Pontiac Firebird, subcompact Kia Rio, and first-generation Kia Sportage
with two-wheel drive. Several sport-utility vehicles showed low rates. Judged by IIHS results, the safest vehicle of all could be the Mercedes-Benz E-Class
sedan, with a driver death rate of 10 per million. Next came the Toyota 4Runner
midsize SUV, Volkswagen Passat
sedan, and Lexus RX 300
(another midsize SUV). Also on the list vehicles with low death rates was the Toyota RAV4, which is a compact sport-utility vehicle. Several of the models with high driver death rates have already ceased production, and the Blazer is being phased out of Chevrolet's lineup. Kia now markets a completely different Sportage model. General Motors responded to the IIHS report by stating that the Blazer was properly tested while in production. GM also questions "what role driver behavior, such as drunk driving and driving without a safety belt, played in these deaths." Trucks, according to a GM statement, are driven more than cars, "often on secondary roads where more rollover crashes occur." The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, which conducts crash tests and engages in safety research, is affiliated with the insurance industry.

Sure it guzzles gas, blocks visibility and is a rather inefficient method of moving singles around a metropolitan area, but "the world's most dangerous vehicle"? Give me a break! Carmudgeon
Why Do You Hate the SUV?
Date Posted 11-01-2002 This month's topic comes courtesy of the September 16, 2002, issue of Automotive News
(with a follow-up story covering the same topic in the October 7 issue). Before getting into the meat of my discussion, I think it bears mentioning that, despite the title, Automotive News
is not a 100-percent, over-the-top, prays-to-the-gods-of-internal-combustion, pro-automotive periodical. This publication, which arrives in my mailbox every Monday morning, generally does an adequate job of presenting both sides of any given topic related to the industry in which I work. However, after reading the "Chorus of SUV critics grows louder" story in the September 16 issue, and then the "Author bases anti-SUV conclusions on statistics" article from the October 7 issue, I felt it was time to address this latest anti-SUV tirade. As someone who finds plenty wrong with the current SUV situation, as chronicled in my column last March, you SUV haters can rest easy knowing I'm never going to defend any of the hypocrites who buy an SUV when they don't need one. What I am going to defend is every American's right to buy an SUV if he wants to, whether he needs it or not.
In both of the Automotive News
stories I've referenced above a gentleman named Keith Bradsher is cited as leading the charge to educate consumers about the real dangers of SUVs. Mr. Bradsher's book, High and Mighty ? SUVs: The World's Most Dangerous Vehicles and How They Got That Way
has an interesting title, though I wonder if "High and Mighty" refers to SUVs or the liberal intelligentsia that often goes around this country trying to "protect us from ourselves for our own good." In this case, I'm inclined to believe the latter simply because Mr. Bradsher partakes of the exact same type of double-talk he claims to be fighting against. Specifically, Mr. Bradsher takes issue with how the automakers paint SUVs as safe, rugged off-road vehicles capable of providing fun and adventure to their owners, even though most of those owners will never go off-road. He thinks the poor American consumer is being duped into buying SUVs by the big, mean automakers that are only interested in making a profit off of these rolling death traps that use too much gas. According to the October 7 issue of Automotive News, Bradsher thinks automakers "manipulate automotive journalists by setting up press events for sport-utilities in exotic off-road locations when they know the vehicle won't be driven that way." It further states "this distracts reviewers from evaluating the vehicles where most people drive them." Wow, and I always thought my staff did a pretty good job of identifying how even the most capable off-road vehicles will rarely be driven off-road by the average owner. Now I learn that my entire editorial team has been carefully "manipulated" by those dastardly automakers. (Can you hear the "protecting us from ourselves" overtones yet?) Thankfully, we all have someone like Mr. Bradsher to shine the light of truth on this otherwise dark and sinister plot, right? Well, not really. When Bradsher says that SUVs use more gas than other types of vehicles, he's generally correct, although many compact, and even some midsize SUVs, can get better mileage than midsize and larger sedans. But where Bradsher clearly crosses the line into deceitful reporting is his assertions that SUVs are inherently dangerous. Indeed, the title of his book calls them "The World's Most Dangerous Vehicles." If you're hearing echoes of Ralph Nader's exuberantly alarmist Unsafe at Any Speed
book from 40 years ago, you're on the right track. To justify his branding of SUVs as the modern-day Corvair, Bradsher points to accident and injury rates that show SUVs being involved in more crashes than full-size sedans or minivans. He specifically cited this point in an interview on Fox's "The O'Reilly Factor" with Bill O'Reilly. But as anyone with basic PR training knows, you can make statistics say whatever you want them to. Saying that SUVs are more dangerous than full-size sedans simply because they are involved in more accidents is like saying people who fly on airplanes are more likely to die in an air disaster when compared to people who never fly. That statement may seem overly simplistic but, remember, people on the ground occasionally die in air disasters, too. The point is that the nature of the driver (just like the nature of people who do or don't fly) is critically important in both arguments. To put it another way, look at the type of people who drive full-size sedans and minivans. In case you don't already know, full-sedans, like the Ford Crown Victoria, Buick Regal or Toyota Avalon, tend to be driven by people over 50. And minivans tend to be driven by parents transporting children (increasingly, minivans are also being driven by people over 50 who have discovered how convenient those huge sliding doors are when it comes time to get in and out of the vehicle ? my in-laws and their Oldsmobile Silhouette being a perfect example). SUVs, on the other hand, tend to be driven by young people, and they often serve as a sort of rolling party because they can carry many bodies (like a minivan) and they have a cool image (pretty much the opposite of a minivan). Yes, lots of housewives have traded in their minivans for an SUV in recent years. But minivans accounted for just over one million in U.S. sales last year, while SUVs accounted for nearly four million. Obviously, it's not just suburban moms who buy these high-profile vehicles. So you have grandparents and parents almost exclusively driving large sedans and minivans, while over in SUV land you have plenty of young, single people carrying all their friends to and from the latest social gathering. And, lo and behold, SUVs have a higher accident rate and injury rate than large sedans and minivans. Bradsher seems to have left this minor point out of his various media interviews. I'd hate to suggest he's using deceptive tactics to make a point and sell a product (sort of like touting the off-road prowess of certain vehicles that will likely never go off-road) but, oh, what the hell, I'm gonna say it anyway. And I'll present this counter argument to Bradsher: If you take two equally skilled, competent and intelligent drivers, and put one in a Lincoln Navigator and the other in a Lincoln LS, the driver in the Navigator is less likely to suffer serious injuries from a traffic accident. Keep in mind that competent and intelligent drivers always wear their seatbelt and understand that SUVs don't handle like a sports car. Or try this one on for size: You have just been told by the Great Spirit that in the next seven days you will be involved in a serious traffic accident. You don't know where, you don't know when, and you don't know the specific nature of the crash, but it will happen. The only factor you can control is what vehicle you will be driving for the next week ? Cadillac Escalade, Honda Odyssey or Toyota Avalon. Which one do you pick, Mr. Bradsher? Keep in mind that the two vehicles you don't
pick will also be involved in the accident. If Bradsher wants to make an argument that it's easier for bad drivers to crash in an SUV than in a minivan, I might actually go along with that argument. But that doesn't make the SUV "the world's most dangerous vehicle," it simply proves what we already knew: even a large, heavy vehicle can't save lousy drivers from themselves. Another point Bradsher fails to mention is the increasingly carlike nature of SUVs. In the last two years, Ford's best-selling SUVs, the Explorer and Expedition, went from riding on a solid rear axle to utilizing an independent rear suspension. This move greatly increased the stability of both vehicles. How do we know this? Well, beyond simple logic and some instrumented testing under controlled conditions, one of our editors recently had to perform a rapid lane change maneuver in our long-term Explorer
after an accident happened right in front of him on a Los Angeles freeway. He swerved hard left and then hard right, recreating the exact driving style that had previous Ford Explorers going rubber side up. In this instance, the 2002 Explorer remained stable and composed. Once again, not bad for being one of "the world's most dangerous vehicles," huh? I'll concede Bradsher's point that most SUV owners never go off-road, and I agree with him that automakers (especially domestic automakers) have more to gain by selling high-priced, high-profit SUVs instead of lower-priced cars. But, as is usually the case, market forces are addressing these issues. Today's SUV buyers demand a more refined and stable vehicle. Foreign automakers were the first ones to offer carlike SUVs, but the domestic manufacturers are quickly catching up (with models like the redesigned Explorer and Expedition). As for vehicle emissions and gas mileage, SUVs are making rapid advances in both areas as well. Honda's new Pilot already has ULEV (ultra low emissions vehicle) certification, and it gets 17/22 miles-per-gallon in city/highway driving (numbers not far behind the minivans and full-size sedans Bradsher has such an affinity for). What Bradsher and the rest of this country's SUV haters need to realize is that the genie is out of the bottle. Fifteen years ago most Americans didn't know what an SUV was, and they certainly didn't realize the kind of people-/cargo-carrying capacity such vehicles offered. They also didn't know how reassuring it feels to sit high above the road surface. Now every American over the age of 10 has either driven or ridden in an SUV, and while most may not like the tippy handling or harsh ride over broken pavement, they love the "king of the road" sensation and versatile seating/cargo options. They also like knowing that, if they wanted to, they could scamper away from the beaten path for an off-road adventure. Unlike Mr. Frost, most will never actually take that road less traveled, but we Americans like having our options open. Once again, I want to emphasize that SUVs are not for everyone, and, like any good American, I don't support single, city-dwelling, white-collar professionals, especially ones that rarely carry more than a briefcase or purse and never go off-road, buying seven-passenger vehicles that get less than 20 mpg. However, my reasoning relates to efficiency and geopolitical circumstances (it'd be good not to further grow our dependence on imported oil). However, I'm not going to sell the public a bunch of misinformation about SUVs being inherently unsafe because, well, they aren't. I also don't appreciate all the hypocritical Hollywood "environmentalists" who claim allegiance to Mother Earth?from the cockpits of their Range Rovers, Navigators and Hummer H2s. Of course, regardless of my or Bradsher's desire to see fewer SUVs on the road, the truth is that these vehicles are not going away. They will undoubtedly continue to get even safer, more refined and more fuel-efficient, but they will never disappear from the American landscape. If that thought bothers you, well, now you know how I've felt for the past two decades about rap music. Rather ironic, actually, when you consider the growing bond between certain SUVs and rap music. But hey, at least SUVs will be getting more
refined as the years pass.

Blazer Most Dangerous Vehicle, Insurance Study Finds March 15, 2005
The Mercedes E-Class sedan is the safest car on the highway, while the least safe is the two-door Chevrolet Blazer, according to a study by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS). The institute reached its conclusions about the Mercedes, Blazer and 197 other relatively popular vehicles by studying driver death rates of 1999 to 2002 model cars and trucks from 2000 to 2003. Among four-door midsize cars, the Volkswagen Passat performed best, with an average of 16 driver deaths per million registered vehicles annually, but the Chrysler Sebring had 126 driver deaths. Among midsize sport utility vehicles with four-wheel drive, the Toyota 4Runner had 12 deaths per million registered vehicles annually, compared with 134 for the two-door Ford Explorer. The study focused on the rate of driver deaths in various types of crashes, including both single- and multiple-vehicle accidents. The overall driver death rate, for 199 models studied during the 2000-2003 calendar years, was 87 per million registered vehicles annually, the institute said. The Blazer had an average of 308 driver deaths per million. It also had the highest rate of driver deaths in rollover accidents at 251 per million. "Large cars and minivans dominate among vehicle models with very low death rates" while those with the highest fatality rates are "mostly small cars and small and midsize SUVs," the study said The Results Lowest Rates of Driver Death

Why an SUV is now the most dangerous vehicle in Iraq
Patrick Graham in Baghdad Sunday April 4, 2004 The Observer
It has become clear in the past few years that four-wheel-drive SUVs are some of the most dangerous vehicles on the road. Nowhere is this more true than in Iraq. In almost every deadly attack on foreign civilians, the victims have been in Sport Utility Vehicles, almost invariably white: the occupation car of choice. The burning wreckage in Falluja last week was unmistakable. The charred bodies of the four Americans were scattered around two white SUVs. The men - Scott Helvenston, from Florida, a producer of extreme fitness videos; Jerry Zovko from Ohio; Wesley Batalona, 48, from Hawaii; and wrestling coach Michael Teague, 38, from Tennessee - were former US special forces members now working for Blackwater, a private security firm that protects Paul Bremer, the coalition's administrator. Falluja is a centre of the anti-American resistance, where even the police don't support the Americans. US soldiers don't drive through Falluja much. When they do, they have helicopter back-up and heavy armour. 'Almost every foreigner who has been killed here is an idiot,' said one ex-Navy SEAL. Soldiers often show little sympathy for those who fail to follow the right procedure. He began listing their mistakes. To start with, they were in Falluja, in an SUV. Next, he guessed they had gone through the city before and had met no problems, but were seen leaving an American base - a routine can kill you. Later, they were followed. 'People don't realise that this is war,' he said. But last week's horrific scenes in Falluja give the wrong impression. Iraq is, in fact, a lot safer than it was last summer. There is less violence now but it is better organised, more methodical. Especially in the capital. You can tell a lot about the security situation in Baghdad by listening to the city. Last summer, there was almost constant gunfire. The city was in chaos and murders and robbery were common. Today, there are police on the streets and it is much safer. The problem is that, while the police presence reduces some kinds of crime, there is nobody in control of the city. For a careful criminal, there are no consequences. The other day, we drove by a café in which gangsters hang out. If someone wants to kill you, this is where they can go. It costs $100 to have someone shot. The killers know they will never be caught. For all the media reports about foreign deaths, life is far more dangerous for Iraqis, especially Iraqis who work for foreigners. And while three journalists have been killed in the past month, they have all been killed by the American army. And they were Arab or Iraqi. This is what Iraqis complain about when they say ' maku amin ', no security. If you anger somebody, he can kill you with impunity. A foreign newspaper bureau here recently tried to fire one of its guards for sleeping on the job. A driver quietly explained that, if the guard were fired, he would hire someone to take revenge. The guard stayed. If you can't threaten someone with a vendetta, then you have very little leverage in negotiations. As a result, the tribeless Christian community has been one of the worst hit by kidnappers. In Baghdad, we listen to bombs exploding rather than chaotic gunfire. One woke us up last week, rattling the windows, blowing in the curtains. Five Iraqis were killed. What were they driving? An SUV. ·
Two attacks on Iraqi police south of Baghdad yesterday left four dead, bringing to 350 the number of policemen killed by shooting and suicide bombings in the past year. Special report

“WHAT WOULD SATAN DRIVE?” AND OTHER UNFAIR QUESTIONS ABOUT SUVs The SUV Problem—Hating Them is Too Simplistic
Given a choice, we suspect that Satan would enjoy driving any vehicle with a Burst Into Flames feature. In any event, should today's SUV drivers be condemned to Dante's 7th circle of Hell (the one known as "Yugo")? SUV bashing has become a popular sport among some. SUVs typically get poor gas mileage, they pollute more than cars, they're more [picture of pristine mountain lake]
dangerous in crashes (both for their occupants and especially for drivers of other vehicles). All these things are true. But in some ways, it is too simplistic to say that SUVs are bad and cars are good. For instance, how many of us are driving the most fuel-efficient, least polluting vehicle available on the market? In addition, other factors—such as how far we choose to commute to work, whether or not we carpool, whether or not we combine trips for errands, whether we're still driving a 15-year-old "blue smoker"—all play a role in determining our personal "driving impact" on the environment. If environmental impact is evaluated for all drivers, SUV owners are likely to score more poorly because of the gas-mileage deficit of the typical SUV as compared to a car. Don't forget, though—some SUVs get better gas mileage than some cars. In the 2004 fuel economy guide released by the US EPA and DOE, the Toyota RAV4 had the highest fuel economy in the SUV category, getting 24 mpg, whereas the best of the large cars, the Chevrolet Malibu, got only 22 mpg. The 2004 vehicle with the worst gas mileage was a car—the Lamborghini L-147, which got only 9 mpg. What??? Is Grinning Planet giving a free pass to purchasers of 6,000-pound gas-guzzling behemoths and other SUVs? No way. Most purchasers of such vehicles don't actually NEED them, and putting status, ego, or macho-ness—or, even worse, exploitation of a tax loophole—above reduction of pollution and imported oil use does indeed deserve scorn. But even if the front part of the Line of People Whose Vehicles and Driving Habits Need Improving is predominantly SUV drivers, all of us can ask ourselves [picture of pristine mountain lake]
whether we can do more to reduce gasoline usage and pollution by purchasing a more environmentally friendly vehicle or developing greener driving habits. And now, for the REAL villains in this debate; those old stand-bys we all love to jab at: Congress and the White House. And we don't just mean the current Congress and White House. For the last dozen years, our elected leaders, in concert with our never-admit-anything-can-be-improved auto manufacturers, have squashed attempts to significantly raise fuel economy standards. This is particularly irksome when it comes to SUVs, since they are driven like cars but are not held to the same gas-mileage standards as cars. We payers-at-the-pump and breathers-of-the-air should be outraged that fuel economy standards have not risen significantly for both SUVs AND cars. It's shameful that the average vehicle today gets worse gas mileage than the average vehicle in 1980. The argument that SUVs and minivans will be unaffordable or unmanufacturable if they are made more fuel efficient is the same sort of gloom-and-doom scaremongering that manufacturers put forth in the 1970s when fuel-economy and pollution standards were first proposed. Car makers CAN apply such measures to SUVs and minivans, and they should. The Union of Concerned Scientists recently designed two SUVs that were safer and more fuel efficient than today's models—without sacrificing size or performance. (See the UCS report here)
Whether you're an anti-SUV crusader who calls them "F-U Vs" or you're an SUV owner who drives one with pride, we should be able to agree that keeping reasonable style and performance choices in the vehicle fleet and making all vehicles safer, more fuel-efficient, and less polluting are both worthwhile and compatible goals.

BRAIN FOOD It is worth noting that although the Toyota RAV4 has slightly better gasoline costs and lower carbon dioxide emissions than the Chevrolet Malibu, it gets worse ratings for emissions of carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, and hydrocarbons.   You can get Grinning Planet free via email each week

  High and Mighty: SUVs—The World's Most Dangerous Vehicles and How They Got That Way
by Keith Bradsher (Non-Fiction)   DESCRIPTION Just what is it that some people hate so much about SUVs? For Keith Bradsher, it's a number of things; but let's start with their gas-guzzling obesity, their higher pollution levels, and their poor safety ratings on the road. Bradsher is also critical of the devious way Detroit has marketed SUVs and slipped them past many of the regulations that apply to "the rest of us," and he's non-too-happy about how our politicians and regulators have let it happen. But this book is not just a rant—it uses facts to make the case. You'll have to read it for yourself to decide whether SUVs really are the world's most dangerous vehicles.

Motorcycles Remain Most Dangerous Vehicles NHTSA Announces Discretionary Cooperative Agreements For Research Under The Crash Injury Research And Engineering Network (CIREN) HRSA To Update State-By-State Self Assessments Of Trauma Care Systems CMS Announces Improved Efforts To Reduce Medicare Payment Error Rates
Motorcycles Remain Most Dangerous Vehicles
While travel by motor vehicle has become steadily safer in the United States, motorcycles remain the most dangerous type of motor vehicle to drive. Motorcyclists are involved in fatal crashes at a rate of 35.0 per 100 million miles of travel compared with a rate of 1.7 per 100 million miles of travel in cars. This study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) examined the association between alcohol impairment and fatal motorcycle crashes. Over the time period 1983 to 2003, the rate of fatal motorcycle crashes among alcohol-impaired drivers declined for drivers under 40 and rose for drivers over 40. The rate of fatal motorcycle crashes among alcohol-impaired drivers was highest among 20-24 year-olds in 1983 and among 40-44 year-olds in 2003. Because older drivers involved in fatal motorcycle crashes are more likely to be alcohol-impaired than younger drivers, future efforts to reduce alcohol-impaired driving among motorcyclists should include older drivers. Additional key findings include: The percentage of fatally injured motorcycle drivers who were alcohol-impaired declined from 1983 to 2003 in all age groups except the 55-59 years old age group. In 1983, 8.2% of the fatally injured motorcycle drivers with elevated blood alcohol concentrations (BAC) were aged 40 or older; by 2003, 48.2% of such drivers were in this age group. Motorcycle drivers in fatal crashes aged 40 and older were more likely to be alcohol impaired than car drivers aged 40 and older. Overall motorcycle mortality rates per 100,000 people declined from 1.6 in 1983 to 0.9 in 1993 and then rose to 1.2 in 2003. Rates for age groups under age 30 declined over this time period, whereas rates for age groups over 40 increased. Proven Community Strategies to Prevent Alcohol-Impaired Driving Include: Sobriety checkpoints 0.08% blood alcohol concentration laws Minimum legal drinking age laws Zero tolerance laws for young or inexperienced drivers School-based approaches to reduce riding with drinking drivers Management-supported intervention training programs for alcohol servers Mass media campaigns that are carefully planned and well executed, that attain sufficient audience exposure, and that are implemented in conjunction with other ongoing prevention activities

NHTSA Announces Discretionary Cooperative Agreements For Research Under The Crash Injury Research And Engineering Network (CIREN) The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) December 8 (69 FR 71101-71118) announced discretionary Cooperative Agreement opportunities to provide funding to Level One Trauma Centers in support of the Crash Injury Research and Engineering Network (CIREN). NHTSA anticipates funding these Cooperative Agreements in annual installments for one base year plus 4 one-year option years at NHTSA's option and subject to available funding. Due to budgetary constraints and the levels of effort applicants may propose, NHTSA is uncertain as to the number of Cooperative Agreements that will be funded. However, multiple awards will be made under this announcement. These cooperative agreements will support projects to improve the prevention, treatment, and rehabilitation of motor vehicle crash injuries to reduce deaths, disabilities and human and economic costs.

The objective of the Cooperative Agreements is to fund CIREN Centers to add to the scope of data and expertise available and to increase CIREN's benefits to the public. NHTSA intends to award up to ten (10) Cooperative Agreements (depending on available funding at the time of award and the levels of effort proposed by the applicants) to support the goals of this initiative. Each Cooperative Agreement recipient will be expected to identify and coordinate an effort that supports the goals outlined in CIREN System Requirements. Subject to the availability of funds, it is anticipated that NHTSA will award up to ten (10) Cooperative Agreements to support the goals of this initiative for a period of five (5) years (i.e., one base year and four one-year Option Years, if exercised). Each Grantee will be expected to coordinate an effort that supports the goals outlined in the CIREN System Requirements. NHTSA anticipates that approximately three million dollars ($3,000,000.00) in total federal funding will be available for award of up to ten (10) Cooperative Agreements under this Federal Register Notice for the base year. Funding for each of the four (4) option years for each of the Grantees will be based on the availability of funds in future fiscal years. HRSA To Update State-By-State Self Assessments Of Trauma Care Systems The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) December 13 (69 FR 72204) to collect data from the 56 States and Territories on their current trauma care systems to assess progress since the initial survey in fiscal year 2002. This information will be used to establish a national strategy to assist in future grant opportunities to the States to improve or enhance their basic systems infrastructure in trauma care delivery, as well as their collection and usage of quality trauma data. HRSA will be collaborating with partners from within HRSA's Healthcare Systems Bureau, Division of Healthcare Preparedness (DHP), Bioterrorism Hospital Preparedness Program; HRSA's Office of Rural Health Policy; and HRSA's Maternal and Child Health Bureau. In addition, HRSA will collaborate with the Office of Public Health Emergency Preparedness; the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality; the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Center for Injury Prevention and Control; the National Highway Traffic and Safety Administration's Emergency Medical Services (EMS) Division; and affiliated professional organizations through the DHP Trauma Program's National Trauma-EMS Stakeholder Group. HRSA has included national performance measures for Trauma/EMS for this project in accordance with the requirements of the "Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) of 1993" (Public Law 103-62). This Act requires the establishment of measurable goals for Federal programs that can be reported as part of the budgetary process, thus linking funding decisions with performance. CMS Announces Improved Efforts To Reduce Medicare Payment Error Rates The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) December 13 announced new steps to measure error rates in Medicare payments more accurately and comprehensively at the contractor level, and to further reduce improper payments through targeted error improvement initiatives. "We have made significant strides in how we measure the error rate in Medicare payments, and that will enable us to do even more to bring it down,” said CMS Administrator Mark B. McClellan, M.D., Ph.D. “We have much better data that will help us pinpoint problems and allow us to work with the Medicare contractors and providers to make sure claims are submitted and paid properly." In addition, independent auditors for CMS issued an unqualified opinion on the agency’s fiscal year 2004 financial statements, which are required by the Government Management Reform Act. This year’s opinion marks the sixth consecutive year that CMS has received an unqualified opinion, demonstrating CMS’ stewardship, discipline and accountability in the implementation of its fiscal responsibilities Under the new measurement process for the Medicare error rate, the net national rate for fiscal year 2004 was 9.3 percent. The enhanced information comes from the first full year of data for an expanded program run by CMS to collect more detailed and contractor-specific information to help prevent future errors. CMS also announced new initiatives to reduce the error rate by more than half to 4 percent in four years, by building on recent reforms in payment oversight and new authorities in the Medicare law. Medicare pays more than 1 billion claims each year. In fiscal year 2004, CMS reviewed approximately 160,000 Medicare claims from the preceding year to learn, more precisely, where errors were being made. This review was the most extensive ever, providing CMS with more accurate information about contractor-specific error rates, error rates by provider type, and error rates by service type. This level of detail and accuracy is critical for CMS to identify where problems exist and target improvement efforts more effectively, and it reflects the agency’s increased commitment to use more detailed data and analysis to identify and eliminate improper payments. “We have developed the best data ever on contractor specific error rates,” said Dr. McClellan. “With this new and detailed information, we are now able to develop specific steps for the Medicare contractors to take more effective actions in reducing the error rates. Using this report and the new, comprehensive data, we can better manage our contractors, making them more accountable to the taxpayers, beneficiaries, and providers, and laying a foundation for the further contractor reforms that we intend to implement in the next few years.” The 2003 analysis identified a large and unexpected increase in the rate of non-responses. CMS adjusted the non-response rate based on past experience with non-responders and other error categories, reporting the 2003 adjusted error rate as 5.8 percent. Without adjusting for the non-response, the 2003 payment error rate would have been 9.8 percent. The 2004 data for error rate analysis was larger and more detailed than the 2003 data, just as the 2003 data was more extensive than data from previous years. Since 1996, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has annually determined the error rate for fee-for-service (FFS) claims paid by Medicare contractors, the insurance organizations that process and pay Medicare claims. From 1996 until 2002, the HHS Office of Inspector General (OIG) using a sample size of about 6,000 claims conducted the process used to measure Medicare payment error rates. The measured error rate declined from 13.8 percent in 1996 to 6.3 percent in 2002. In fiscal year 2003, and as part of the agency’s enhanced efforts to improve payment accuracy, CMS began calculating the Medicare FFS error rate and estimate of improper claim payments using a methodology approved by the OIG for the past two years. Since 2003, the OIG has assisted CMS in developing, reviewing, and formulating further actions based on the more extensive data collection. "The assistance provided by the Office of Inspector General is helping us improve our accuracy and effectiveness in identifying and responding to problems in paying claims,” said Dr. McClellan. “The majority of providers are honest and want to make sure they file their claims correctly so they can be paid timely, and we’re taking new steps to work with our contractors to make sure that happens, as we move forward with fundamental contractor reform over the next few years.” CMS’ more extensive survey, involving a more comprehensive analysis of a larger number and variety of claims, was accompanied by well-coordinated outreach to health care providers to improve claims submissions. CMS established two programs to monitor the accuracy of Medicare FFS payments: The Comprehensive Error Rate Testing (CERT) program and the Hospital Payment Monitoring Program (HPMP). The main objective of the CERT program and HPMP is to measure the degree to which CMS and its contractors are meeting the goal of “Paying it Right.” The 2004 analysis does not adjust the non-response rate, and also includes other data improvements that reflect input from Congress and other oversight partners. In particular, the sample of claims for fiscal intermediaries, who process and pay Medicare Part A claims, was doubled from the prior year so that intermediary-specific error rates could be calculated at the same levels as the Medicare carriers (Part B contractors) and durable medical equipment regional carriers. The data now permits accounting for appeals involving all types of benefits (not just hospital benefits). Thus, the more comprehensive error rates of the last 2 years are illustrative of CMS’ new measurement process. Of the total payments sampled in 2004, results of the new measurement program indicate the following payment error traits: 4.1 percent of payments had errors due to insufficient documentation being submitted (2.6 percent was reported in the 2003 analysis, which included much less information on fiscal intermediaries in 2003); 2.8 percent had errors due to non-responses to request for medical records (an unadjusted 5.0 percent rate was found in 2003); 1.6 percent had errors due to medically unnecessary services (1.3 percent in 2003); 0.7 percent had errors due to incorrect coding (0.7 percent in 2003); and the remaining 0.1 percent had other errors (0.2 percent in 2003). The claims included in this analysis were submitted before many of the agency’s recently-implemented initiatives to reduce error rates took effect. The more comprehensive data provides CMS with the opportunity to enhance and expand its efforts to monitor the impact of these initiatives. As part of its general efforts to further reduce the Medicare error rate, the CMS contractors will be required to: Develop corrective action plans that include efforts to educate providers about the importance of submitting thorough and complete medical records; Identify where additional review of claims and education on submitting claims is needed, based on information that shows where the highest percentage of errors on overused billing codes are occurring; and Use the performance results to develop local efforts to lower their error rates by addressing the cause of the errors and outlining corrective steps. "We've taken major steps in recent years to get much better data on payment accuracy for each and every one of our contractors, and in every case, better measures mean an ability to reduce error rate for those contractors,” said Dr. McClellan. “We've taken a major step this year to improve data on the fiscal intermediaries, and we are now using this information to drive down their error rates in the same way." In addition, CMS is continually developing educational material and information for healthcare providers as part as of "The Medicare Learning Network.” CMS has developed over 250 national provider education articles annually that outline, on a flow basis and in plain language, the coverage, billing and coding rules associated with Medicare program changes.

Wall Street Journal, 2/9/93: "The Most Dangerous Vehicle on the Road" by Walter Olson
  "The Most Dangerous Vehicle On the Road" By Walter Olson Wall Street Journal, February 9, 1993 Jury interviews suggest that last month's $ 105 million verdict in Moseley v. General Motors was based in part on anger at GM's unrepentance: Despite lawsuits and press reports fingering its 1973-87 trucks as unsafe, the company has refused to concede they are flawed at all. Soon after the verdict GM continued its defiance by counterattacking, charging that crash tests done for an NBC expose' in November were rigged by attaching incendiary devices to the trucks. Serious though these charges might seem, some have already dismissed them as GM damage control. Are the trucks, in fact, unsafe? Try to identify from this list the GM truck that Clarence Ditlow, director of the Center for Auto Safety, told NBC was a "rolling firebomb" and that NBC, summing up his charges, described as the "most dangerous vehicle out there on the road." Fatal Crash Rate (per 10,000 registered vehicle years) (National Highway Traffic Safety Administration)
A 1.162 B 1.446 C 1.514 D 1.652 E 1.824 F 2.212 G 2.347 H 2.455 The correct answer is C, the GM full-size vehicle in the Moseley case. (Seventeen-year old Shannon Moseley died in the fire after his GM truck was hit by a drunken driver.) Of the entries on the list with worse records, D represents passenger cars as a general average; E, F, G, and H, light pickup trucks from various makers (Ford, Nissan, Toyota, Chrysler). Of course, one must approach numbers of this sort with caution: For example, models bought by younger and more aggressive drivers may show higher crash rates through no fault of their design. Still, anyone who imagines the GM truck (1.514) an unconscionable death trap would also be wise to avoid the large majority of other vehicles on the road (1.652 to 2.455). Many analysts cry foul at comparing full-size pickups to smaller vehicles, since bigger is known to be safer as a general rule. In the litigation context, that's a strange cavil: If auto makers may freely offer small trucks to the public, why punish them for offering a large truck with a much better safety rating? But in any case, consider B, the full-size Ford entry, which was in fact the market's closest competitor to the GM model. (A, Dodge's full-size entry, did not score a hit with consumers, whatever its safety virtues.) Ford's very thin edge over the GM model may or may not represent anything more than statistical noise, driver bias, and so forth. Anyone who chooses to live in a wood rather than a brick house accepts a far wider adverse safety differential. One policy, of course, would be to punish any firm that fell behind in safety competition, as determined years later in statistical retrospect. That would ensure litigators a steady supply of provender, much as if, out on the veld, they were entitled to munch on whichever gazelles were at the rear of the pack. (The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety has acknowledged, by the way, that the current safety scare is unlikely to add materially to the premiums that GM truck owners pay; the accidents in question are far too rare.) When trial lawyers took their case to the general public through the media, they stressed intuition rather than statistics. It seems that GM, alone among auto makers, had gone about hanging gas tanks on the side of its trucks like dartboards, outside the protective frame rail. The tanks "were placed in about as stupid a place as they can possibly be placed," one of the plaintiff's lawyers informed "NBC Dateline." In a "side impact or a sideswipe impact, " plaintiff s expert Byron Bloch explained to a rapt NBC reporter, "the fuel tank gets crushed ... There is an immediate holocaust." So the overall numbers didn't matter. GM's design choice had invited specific, avoidable deaths, and the company must be punished. As it turns out, neither NBC nor most other news outlets bothered to report that the GM trucks have actually scored better over the years in avoiding fatal crashes when it comes to side-impact collisions, their presumed weak point. Specifically, the full-size GM trucks did slightly better (.196 fatal side-impact crashes per 10,000 registered vehicle years) than the comparable Fords (.200) and almost as well as the Dodges (.190), though the three are bunched so closely together that the numbers hardly matter. How on earth could these trucks have done better in side crashes, given that GM itself chose to move the tanks inboard in a 1988 redesign? Maybe the numbers are a fluke. Or maybe it's that the trade-offs in car safety are not well understood even by experts. Any possible placement of the fuel tank "causes" some accidents and averts others. Respectable designers have tried every gas-tank location at one time or another: front (as in old Volkswagen Beetles), rear (the Ford Pinto and many others), inside the passenger compartment (older trucks), or underneath (now usual, despite the hazards of flying gravel, sparks, ground-slams, and broken axles). All have been rejected at other times as unsafe. Maybe the distinctive narrow frame of GM trucks--popular with customers, but damned by the plaintiff's lawyers because it required the gas tanks to be placed outboard--offers some sort of obscure advantage in side crashes. It's hard to know. We do know that although you are apparently no more likely to have a fatal side-impact crash in your GM truck, if you do have one it is somewhat more likely to involve a fire. To that extent, intuition--but not the trial lawyers' case--is vindicated. We also know that in GM trucks, as in all other kinds, you are much more likely to die in a front-end than in a side crash, and vastly more likely to die in a crash without a fire than in one with. When fire is present in a fatal crash, it's often in the sort of high-force collisions that would have been lethal in any case--though the jury viewed the Moseley case as an exception. And--hardly a surprise given the statistics--it turns out that GM gas tanks are not exactly as fragile or exposed as DDT eggshells, as viewers might have concluded from watching the NBC video or trial lawyer's summations. The tanks not only complied with but far exceeded the U.S. government's safety standards, which specifically address the danger of gas-tank breakage in side crashes. (Fully obeying this kind of law, it turns out, will not keep you from getting sued.) In fact it takes about 4,000 side-impact crashes in a GM pickup to get one fire with a major injury or fatality, which means the supposed "rolling fire-bombs" may compare favorably with haystacks or mounds of feathers as objects to crash into. The more data we see on the safety record of existing cars, the more dubious the safety scares of the past begin to look. The Audi 5000 affair, in which one of the safest cars on the road was wrongly accused of "sudden acceleration," is only the best known of a whole series of lawsuit-driven campaigns that have collapsed in disgrace and refutation. Remarkably, even the affair of the "exploding" Ford Pinto--universally hailed as the acme of product liability success--is starting to look like hype. In a summer 1991 Rutgers Law Review article Gary Schwartz demolishes "the myth of the Pinto case." Actual deaths in Pinto fires have come in at a known 27, not the expected thousand or more. More startling, Schwartz shows that everyone's received ideas about the fabled "smoking gun" memo are false.  The actual memo did not pertain to Pintos, or even Ford products, but to American cars in general; it dealt with rollovers, not rear-end collisions; it did not contemplate the matter of tort liability at all, let alone accept it as cheaper than a design change; it assigned a value to human life because federal regulators, for whose eyes it was meant, themselves employed that concept in their deliberations; and the value it used was one that they, the regulators, had set forth in documents. In retrospect, Schwartz writes, the Pinto's safety record appears to have been very typical of its time and class. Ford, like GM, lost a $ 100 million verdict, although not much of that survived appeal. The scandal of punitive damages is that they're handed down with none of the due-process protections we'd accord targets charged with genuine criminal wrongdoing: strong screening of unreliable evidence, proof beyond a reasonable doubt, prosecution by independent professionals rather than interested parties, and so forth. Until we furnish such protection, punitive damages--as in the Moseley case--will threaten to make a travesty of justice. **** Walter Olson, senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, is the author of The Litigation Explosion.

  The most dangerous squad in Baghdad
By P. Mitchell Prothero
United Press International
Baghdad, Iraq, Jul. 7 (UPI) -- "How'd you end up with us, is this an embed?" the ridiculously young looking soldier asked me as we crouched on the roof of a power transformer station, surveying downtown Baghdad. He's peering down the sight of his belt-fed machine gun at a group of Iraqis located about 500 meters (yards) away towards the Tigris River when he realizes that they're armed. "Shit, shit, they have weapons," he yells across the roof at his corporal. "So fucking kill them," comes the pithy reply from the other ridiculously young solider. "Wait, wait. They're ICDC or ING or whatever the fuck they're called now," yells another. "They're with us." In the last week the Iraqi Civil Defense Corps has been renamed the Iraqi National Guard, a distinction that only means that the Iraqis will not be killed by the four man team that's protecting this impromptu command post. The roof is hot. Baghdad's high temperature on Wednesday is 118 degrees and the men of squad two, second platoon of the 1st Cavalry Division's 1-9 Regiment have already lost three men to the heat and it's only about half past noon. When told that I had just happened to hook up with their unit after being caught in the middle of a running gun battle in central Baghdad, one of the men laughs. "Well asshole, you just hooked up with the most dangerous squad in Baghdad," he says without looking up from his weapon, which is now trained on a small group of men several blocks away who are certainly not ING. Just what might be ordinary bravado from a young soldier echoes across the cement rooftop, his squad-mate clarifies. "No really we are," he says. "Out of the 11 of us, only two haven't won the Purple Heart in the last four months. It sucks to be us." He means that to be in his unit offers a nine out of 11 chance to be wounded in action. Having been quiet for the past 10 days as Iraq saw its sovereignty returned, insurgents picked the morning that the interim Prime Minister Iyad Allawi announced sweeping security measures that effectively allow him to declare martial law to stamp out Iraq's bloody insurgency to attack U.S. and ING forces in central Baghdad. Terror attacks are common in Baghdad. Insurgents attacking convoys and U.S. bases outside Baghdad are frequent. But masked gunmen running through central Baghdad in fire fights with police, ING and U.S. military is unheard of. It barely happened during the invasion of Iraq. The morning began with a mortar attack on Allawi's residence, which we couldn't get close enough to investigate. Then suddenly traffic became even worse than its typically insufferable level. And the sight of U.S. Apache attack helicopters sweeping on firing runs in downtown Baghdad indicated something major was happening. Having deftly avoided much of the traffic, my driver and I were looking for what was happening, expecting a cordon of military vehicles keeping us away from the action. What we didn't expect was that our deftness -- a result of my driver's surreal ability to avoid traffic jams -- would drive ourselves into the middle of a firefight. As bullets flew around our car, which was hastily abandoned, we ran for the shelter of a nearby hospital. We could see U.S. troops far down the broad boulevard. And there was a lot of firing, but we couldn't see who was shooting or at what. But we could hear the bullets smacking trees nearby the now abandoned car and U.S. troops at the end of the road weren't shooting or getting shot at, making the usual calculations of how to safely cover a firefight -- avoid the people getting shot at -- useless. Having decided that the car was a safer option than huddling and waiting to figure out who was doing the shooting, we broke for the car and headed for the nearest Iraqi Police station to find out what was going on. The police station was milling with police carrying assault rifles and some casually mentioned that they were currently under attack from unknown forces. But the shooting had just stopped, likely connected to the missiles fired from an Apache overhead and the black smoke pluming into the sky a few blocks away. Just as the Iraqis were trying to decide whether they were still under attack, three Bradley Fighting Vehicles of the 1st Cav. arrived and dumped three squads of infantry into the area. As they took up defensive positions, they uncharacteristically ignored me, probably due to gunfire directed on their positions. It wasn't well aimed and hit no one in the vicinity, but it caused the platoon leader to send out a squad to stop it. Walking the streets of Haifa -- the neighborhood -- was tense and full of intermittent gunfire, causing the squad to take a solid 30 minutes to travel just a handful of blocks. Having picked the power station as a base, it was checked and gunners assigned to the roof to protect both the station itself and provide supporting fire to a group of ING reportedly a few blocks away. They were pinned down by insurgents and had three wounded men. So several armored vehicles arrived with the rest of the platoon and a rescue mission planned in the small courtyard of the building. It was decided that the rescue operation -- headed to the building four blocks away -- would be done on foot. As the 1st Lieutenant commanding the platoon conferred over maps and with his company commander by radio, a hulking sergeant major addressed the men. "We are expecting resistance, this is full weapons on, men," he bellowed. "If you don't like it, soldier, then shoot it. Shoot boxes or anything you think might be an (improvised explosive device). They are expecting us." Setting out in long lines of men covering each side of the street, the soldiers faced not only the odd gunshot, threat of ambush, or, worse, a roadside bomb, but also the stares of Iraqis who were gathering outside their homes and shops to watch the deadly show. Some scowled, others waved, and the men of second platoon were not happy walking through a rough neighborhood of Baghdad in daylight with little armored vehicle support. And the Apaches had run out of fuel and retuned home so there was no air cover. But as they moved down a side alley along, little happened. Leaving the alley, they broke into the open and quickly established a defensive perimeter around the ING building. One squad ran for the entrance, as the others provided cover, only to find the building locked. "Open this door or I'll open it myself," one soldier yelled at a confused Iraqi man outside the building who clearly had no idea what he was talking about. The ING, it turns out, had already left, even remembering to lock up the facility. "I hate this shit," said the lieutenant. "We have terrible (communications) with the ICDC or ING, or whatever they are. I can't believe this." But even as the group withdraws, one soldier sees something a block away. And a report of men using a nearby house to stage attacks has just come through. Three doors are hit. The first two have only women and children. The third small building has 12 fighting age men in it. And all of their identification is suspicious enough that -- despite the absence of weapons -- it's decided to arrest them for questioning. So second platoon marches their 12 prisoners -- and a growing band of curious reporters -- back the vehicles. As they are loaded into armored vehicles for the ride back to the unit's forward operating base, one of the men manages to slip away and actually sits down at a café down the block pretending like he wasn't involved. A translator for one news organization notices and the reporter innocently asks one soldier why the man was let go. "Get that guy," cries the lieutenant, who then walks over to the café himself and grabs the man, who doesn't even try and deny anything. He just shrugs and follows his friends into the back of the vehicle. Moments later, rifle shots ring out as one soldier notices that the street down the block is now littered with cardboard boxes. He carefully puts a round through each one to make sure none holds a roadside bomb. "You can't be too careful in Baghdad," he shrugs. [UPI Perspectives]

Name: Email: Crime is defined by the Merriam-Webster dictionary as
an act or the commission of an act that is forbidden or the omission of a duty that is commanded by a public law and that makes the offender liable to punishment by that law.   Laws are designed to protect us and ensure our safety in all aspects of our lives: physical, financial, psychological and social.  Yet not a day does go by that we don’t hear of crimes taking place in our city or state.  When a crime is committed, public safety becomes endangered and specific individuals or groups may feel violated.  While we would like to avoid such events, they take place all too often.  Here are some statistics that demonstrate this:
Every two
minutes, somewhere in America, someone is sexually assaulted.
In 2002, there were a total of 4,854 cases of aggravated assault in
Washington DC.  On a daily basis, this computes to 13.2 aggravated assaults a day.
In Maryland, there were 3,228 cases of larceny and thefts per 100,000 people in 2002.  This is one-third higher than the national average rate of 2,445.8 cases per 100,000.
In Detroit, there were 41.79 murders per 100,000 people in 2002.  This is alarmingly way above the national average rate of 5.6 for the same year.
In 2002, with the exception of burglaries, Philadelphia
led all crime levels which were above the national average rates for murder, forcible rape, robbery, aggravated assaults, larceny/theft and motor vehicle theft.
To find out more crime statistics in the
US, visit the
University of Michigan Library.
In addition to crimes against individuals,   
Corporate crime
has recently jolted the corporate world with the likes of the
Enron
scandal and the
Martha Stewart
arrest.  Across
America, worker rights are often violated by threats of firing and other reprisals made to those who dare to exercise their lawful right to collective bargaining and unions.   In 2000, when a department of meat cutters at a Wal-Mart center in
Texas
voted 7-3 in favor of unionization, Wal-Mart eliminated the meat cutting department, choosing instead to pre-cut meats, resulting in the elimination of meat cutting jobs nationwide.  The garment and fabric factories
of
New York
are filled with immigrant workers, many of whom do not have proper working documents. Many of these workers end up enduring poor working conditions for fear of deportation and
INS
investigations, encouraged by the factory owners.  Through collective bargaining, unions protect the rights of workers by giving them fair representation in the work place.  On the contrary, some union leaders have been charged for their involvement in crime activities (racketeering, fraud and tax evasion, embezzlement, and extortion).  Union or not, corporate crime exists on both ends of the continuum, where the workers continue to be victimized and their rights violated.   
Another major type of crime is terrorism.  The tragic events of 9/11 and the terrorists that brought on those acts of destruction have changed the lives of Americans forever.  Support the
fight against terrorism.  
The War on Drugs
deals with addressing the violation of drug laws.  Tremendous resources have been devoted and spent on this war, locally and internationally.  The recent extradition
of drug criminal Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela to the
US
is a sign that indeed the
US
is continuing to wage a war against drug crime.
Social and Economic Problems Caused by Crime
Our social and economic problems are often a direct result of crime.  In a vicious circle, these problems can fuel crime even more.  For example, those who commit theft and burglaries often do so because of their need for money.  These individuals may be unemployed, incapable of finding work, homeless, sick or impoverished.  These crimes become a tempting way to quickly acquire money.  Unfortunately, when left unpunished, these individuals get the misconception that crime pays.  It is this thinking that encourages some individuals to continue their criminal ways, discouraging them from finding other activities that would give them some normality and stability in their lives.  This way of thinking reinforces crime.
Another crime, prostitution, is frequently associated with drug addiction.  Many prostitutes find it difficult to change their work because of their drug addiction.  Drugs require significant cash and prostitution provides this, faster and easier than legitimate work.  Prostitution often will lead to other crimes such as
people trafficking,
sexual abuse, and rape.  Those who exploit women often have no regard for people’s lives.  This disregard often leads to physical abuse and even murder.  In addition, prostitution can increase the spread of diseases such as AIDS, other
STD’s and hepatitis. 
On a larger scale, drug addiction fuels the illicit drug industry.  Through our web site War on Drugs, you can learn more about the social and economic problems that drugs cause.  In organized crime, you will find other violations related to drug trafficking.  These include money laundering, smuggling and illegal sale of weapons, credit card fraud and counterfeiting.  Poverty often leads to the problem of homelessness.  Those who live on the streets often experience hunger and disease making them more likely to resort to committing theft and burglary as a means to eat or to obtain medicine.  Out on the streets the homeless
are exposed more to the risks of drug addiction and other unwanted social behaviors.  All of these factors fuel crime.
Solving the Root Causes of Crime
In order to eradicate crime, we need to address the root causes.  These include, but are not limited to, greed, inadequate corporate oversight, poverty, lack of education, homelessness, drug addiction, racial hatred, and lax gun laws.  Education is one of the biggest factors that plays a role in what becomes of an individual in their adulthood.  Those who have an education possess the training and skills needed to make them marketable to potential employers.  Indeed, even for jobs that pay only a minimum wage, employers likely will prefer interviewing candidates with a decent education over those without.  Thus, many of the uneducated may find themselves unemployed, living in sub-standard housing and in impoverished conditions.  And as money becomes scarce, many of them might be tempted to engage in criminal activities.  At Grassroots.org, we encourage everyone to pursue formal education and stress the importance of governments and universities helping make it accessible to all.  We strongly believe that every American citizen deserves an education and it’s especially important to make it more available to those families who are not able to readily afford it. Education can help eradicate poverty, which will in turn reduce the crime rate.
Poverty often pushes children to drop out of school.  Those children who do not attend school may end up roaming the streets, exposing themselves to criminal elements and activities.  This is why it is imperative that communities provide safe places where children can gather inside, away from street life.  These include school clubs, youth clubs, and sports and recreational centers where children and youth are given support and supervision through educational and developmental programs.  Without alternatives to schools, children can easily get involved in petty crimes such as shoplifting, residential break-ins, car theft and vandalism.  After the petty crimes, these children may graduate into the more serious crimes of drug trafficking, sexual offences and gang violence.
Crime can also be related to the probability of being caught and the extent of possible sentencing.  On our web site Sexual Abuse, we present information showing that most rapes and most acts of sexual abuse are committed by individuals with whom the victims are related or otherwise acquainted.  Such relationships can discourage victims from reporting incidents to law enforcement agencies, thus failing to bring the culprits to justice.  Part of the underreporting problem is the social stigma that is attached to these victims.  Although they are victims, they are often blamed for the crime, labelled as being promiscuous and loose.  This allows the real offenders to get away unpunished, leaving them free to offend again.  As citizens, we need to adopt laws and reporting procedures that will give full physical and psychological protection to victims who report crime.  Let us not allow offenders to get away with their crimes, giving them an opportunity to repeat.
Corporate crime is becoming increasingly global and its consequences can be devastating.  Consumers are defrauded.  Our environment (soil, air and water) is often compromised.  Our personal safety can be placed at risk by lobbyists who buy influence but do not have the interest of the greater majority at heart.  A case in point is the
Federal Ban on Assault Weapons.  The National Rifle Association, a powerful lobbyist organization that opposes the federal ban, including background checks at gun shows, has been a very large donor of money to political parties since 1989.  Although the federal ban and background checks help to ensure our safety, these two issues remain unresolved today.  Visit our web site
Lobbyists
for a more thorough discussion on influence buying.  Scandals such as the Enron accounting fraud have resulted in job loss, pension loss, investment loss, a negative impact on the confidence of the American public on the corporate system, loss of taxes due to the Treasury and more.  Today, as reported by
Citizen Works, there are many other corporations today being investigated for irregular accounting practices.  A few examples are K-Mart, Qwest Communications, WorldCom and Xerox.
We must work to curtail corporate greed.  The practice of “influence buying” needs to be stopped.  Corporations must have tighter controls over their accounting reporting procedures.  We call for greater transparency as well so that irregularities in accounting practices can be detected early to mitigate any damages.  The practice of corporate disclosure needs to be widened.  This will allow consumers and shareholders to become fully aware of corporate records on the environment, human rights, worker safety and financial matters.  It will also allow us to know about corporate criminal records and litigation records.  Multiple functions within consulting firms need to be severed and made independent from each other to prevent conflicts of interest.  The Arthur Andersen firm was caught in such a conflict in the Enron scandal, as the firm served both as the accountants and consultants for Enron.  Arthur Andersen was later found guilty of obstruction of justice.  The company was essentially shut down by that and other accounting scandals.
Our prison rehabilitation and prison systems need reform.  A
report
published by the Urban Institute confirms that although the number of parolees regularly being released from our prison system is large, the number of them going back into prison is alarming.  In 1980, as many as 27,000 parolee violators returned to prisons. By 2000, this number increased to 203,000.  This amount represents a 652 percent increase.  There are a number of reasons for this:
Continuing social problems drive parolees back to crime. 
The number of parole officers is not enough to handle the demand of case loads. 
Educational and vocational programs for inmates in prisons need improvement.
Prison personnel need more training in prison based inmate rehabilitation.  This will ensure a higher success rate of inmate re-integration in to society.  Many private prisons have high staff turnover, chronic understaffing and inexperienced correctional officers.  These private prisons are focused primarily on profit, with the inmates being secondary concerns.
If those in charge of our prison system give priority first and foremost to the rehabilitation and re-integration of inmates, this in turn will have a positive effect on the reduction of crime.
Calls to Action
As law abiding citizens, it is imperative that we live our lives according to the rules of our land.  It is also our civic duty to report any crimes that we witness.  The reasons are simple: our laws are meant to preserve the quiet and peaceful enjoyment of living in this great country of the
United States.  Anytime a law is broken, it can compromise the safety of our citizens.  What makes our nation so great is the freedom given to us by our forefathers: our freedom of speech, of religion, of protest, to vote, to get an education, to go to work, to information and many more!  These freedoms are valuable and precious to all of us.  These freedoms are the reasons why the
UShas waged several battles on crime including the War on Drugs and the War on Terrorism. 
Although the costs of these battles are plenty, the rewards are worth it.   9/11 has changed our lives forever, no doubt.  Today, there are Americans who still live in fear of when and where the next terrorist attacks will happen.  Immediately after the strikes on the
World
Trade
Center, such fear was overwhelming and widespread.  There is great debate on whether the
US
is winning the war in
Iraq.  Many question whether our soldiers should even be there.  However, there is no question that 9/11 has not repeated itself in
USsoil. There is also no question in our minds that the War on Drugs is having a positive effect given the fall and extradition of many Colombian drug lords.  Grassroots.org is asking you to support our law enforcement agencies.  Give encouragement to those who put their lives on the line to protect our freedoms.  And most importantly, let each of us live according to the laws of our nation.  Democracy is powerful.  Freedom makes the war on crime even more worth it!

Background information
Conference of the Parties
Address by Ambassador Luigi Lauriola, Chairman of the Ad Hoc Committee on The Elaboration of a Convention Against Transnational Organized Crime at The Millenium Assembly of the United Nations General Assembly, New York, November 2000 The Convention represents a major step forward in the fight against transnational organized crime and signifies the recognition of UN Member States that this is a serious and growing problem that can only be solved through close international cooperation. The Convention, concluded at the 10th session of the Ad Hoc Committee established by the General Assembly to deal with this problem, is a legally binding instrument committing States that ratify it to taking a series of measures against transnational organized crime. These include the creation of domestic criminal offences to combat the problem, and the adoption of new, sweeping frameworks for mutual legal assistance, extradition, law-enforcement cooperation and technical assistance and training. States Parties will be able to rely on one another in investigating, prosecuting and punishing crimes committed by organized criminal groups where either the crimes or the groups who commit them have some element of transnational involvement. This should make it much more difficult for offenders and organized criminal groups to take advantage of gaps in national law, jurisdictional problems or a lack of accurate information about the full scope of their activities. The Convention deals with the fight against organized crime in general and some of the major activities in whichï¿½transnational organized crime is commonly involved, such as money laundering, corruption and the obstruction of investigations or prosecutions. To supplement the Convention, two Protocols also tackle specific areas of transnational organized crime that are of particular concern to UN Member States. The Protocol against the Smuggling of Migrants deals with the growing problem of organized criminal groups who smuggle migrants, often at high risk to the migrants and at great profit for the offenders. The Protocol against Trafficking in Persons deals with the problem of modern slavery, in which the desire of people to seek a better life is taken advantage of by organized criminal groups. Migrants are often confined or coerced into exploitive or oppressive forms of employment, often in the sex trade or in dangerous occupations, with the illicit incomes generated from these activities going to organized crime. The Protocols also commit countries which ratify them to making the basic subject of the Protocol a criminal offence and to adopting other specific measures, such as controls on travel documents, to combat the problem. These supplement the more general measures found in the Convention, and countries must become parties to the Convention itself before they can become parties to any of the Protocols. A third Protocol, dealing with the illicit manufacturing of and trafficking in firearms, parts and components, and ammunition, remains under discussion. The texts of these documents were developed over 11 sessions of the Ad Hoc Committee, and footnoted texts may be found under each session. The Convention was finalized at the 10th session, and the complete text forms part of the Report of that session. The Protocols dealing with the smuggling of migrants and trafficking in persons were finalized at the 11th session and are reported there. These three instruments were adopted by the UN Millenium General Assembly on 15 November 2000, and final texts are included in the Report of that session. Instruments Finalized instruments: United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime and following protocols: Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children, supplementing the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime Protocol against the Smuggling of Migrants by Land, Air and Sea, supplementing the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime (PDF) English,

Organized Crime
This compilation of resources focuses on adult gangs, gangsters, the mafia, and international gangs. For more information about youth gangs, look under Gangs. "Transnational organized crime will be one of the major problems facing policy makers in the 21st century. It will be a defining issue of the 21st century as the Cold War was for the 20th century and Colonialism was for the 19th. No area of international affairs will remain untouched as political and economic systems and the social fabric of many countries will deteriorate under the increasing financial power of international organized crime groups." -Louise Shelley, Director of TraCCC.

http://www.nagia.org/Crips_and_Bloods.htm
Surprisingly, little has been written about the historical significance of black gangs in Los Angeles (LA). Literature and firsthand interviews with Los Angeles residents seem to point to three significant periods relevant to the development of the contemporary black gangs. The first period, which followed WWII and significant black migrations from the South, is when the first major black clubs formed. After the Watts rebellion of 1965, the second period gave way to the civil rights period of Los Angeles where blacks, including those who where former club members who became politically active for the remainder of the 1960s. By the early 1970s black street gangs began to reemerge. By 1972, the Crips were firmly established and the Bloods were beginning to organize. This period saw the rise of LA’s newest gangs, which continued to grow during the 1970s, and later formed in several other cities throughout the United States by the 1990s. While black gangs do not make up the largest or most active gang population in Los Angeles today, their influence on street gang culture nationally has been profound. Article by Alejandro A. Alonso.

http://www.nagia.org/Hybrid_Gangs.htm
As the "gangsta" culture continues to spread throughout North America, the influence of California and Chicago gangs are now being felt in both large metropolitan areas and with increasing frequency in small, rural communities. The lesson has been well-learned that the problem of street gangs is one that touches all ethnic and socio-economic classes. However, as law enforcement agencies have attempted to deal with the gang problem in their respective communities, some very significant differences have been discovered from the historic perception of these gangs, and their behaviors in areas outside of Chicago or Los Angeles.

http://usinfo.state.gov/regional/ea/chinaaliens/polishprof.htm
Paper delivered by Professor Emil W. Plywaczewski, Ph.D., at the 3rd Annual Symposium "Crime and Its Control in Greater China", June 21-22, 2002, University of Hong Kong, PRC. Summary: Chinese organized crime has become well established in every major Chinese community across the world, Plywaczewski says. Members include community leaders as well as ordinary workers. "It is difficult to penetrate this subculture," Plywaczewski writes, "because members have no prior criminal records.... They can conceal their criminal activities through their involvement in lawful business activities." Plywaczewski provides detailed information on Chinese people-smuggling operations in Austria, Hungary, Poland and other European countries. He notes that Chinese criminal groups operate in isolated "cells," each with a specific duty and unaware of other cells in the criminal operation except the one from which it accepts assignments. In the case of people smuggling, some organizations will, for a higher fee, provide their "customers" with "a guarantee of effectiveness." That is, the smugglers guarantee that they will get their client to a target country no matter how many times they might be stopped by law enforcement.

http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/nij/international/chinese.html
The organizational structure of Chinese organized crime in the United States is quite complex. Broadly defined, there is a great variety of Chinese criminal organizations. These include gangs, secret societies, triads, tongs, Taiwanese organized crime groups, and strictly US-based tongs and gangs. According to Ko-lin Chin, the foremost academic expert in the U.S. on Chinese organized crime, there is no empirical support for the belief that there is a well-organized, monolithic, hierarchical criminal cartel called the "Chinese Mafia." Chin says: "My findings...do not support the notion that a chain of command exists among these various crime groups or that they coordinate with one another routinely in international crimes such as heroin trafficking, money laundering, and the smuggling of aliens" (1996:123).

http://www.fbi.gov/hq/cid/orgcrime/ocshome.htm
Organized crime, in the U.S. and around the world, is a critical concern of the law enforcement community. The cooperation among these organized criminal enterprises in recent years has allowed them to greatly increase the scope and magnitude of their illicit activities. Our world has seen widespread and unprecedented political, economic, social, and technological changes in the last two decades. Organized criminal enterprises have been quick to take advantage of the opportunities created by these changes to satisfy their greed and lust for power. The cost to communities and individuals, in terms of pain and suffering caused by the violence and exploitation associated with these organizations, is incalculable. Also the damage to society resulting from these criminal organizations and their influence on labor unions, political institutions, financial markets, and major industries is immeasurable. In fact, a look at the economic impact alone gives a glimpse of the importance of this issue. The Center for Strategic and International Studies, Global Organized Crime Project, Financial Crimes Task Force estimates global organized crime reaps profits of close to $1 trillion per year. The FBI's fight against organized crime is unlike other criminal programs. Instead of focusing on these crimes as individual events, the FBI's Organized Crime Program targets the entire organization responsible for a variety of criminal activities. The FBI has found that even if key individuals in an organization are removed, the depth and financial strength of the organization often allows the enterprise to continue.

The rapid spread of international crime since the end of the Cold War is unprecedented in scale, facilitated by globalization and technological advances, and poses a significant challenge to the United States and democratic governments and free market economies around the world. The President has identified international crime as a direct and immediate threat to the national security of the United States. To meet this challenge, the Departments of Justice, State, and Treasury--working closely with numerous federal agencies--jointly developed a comprehensive national strategy to fight international crime and reduce its impact on Americans. The International Crime Control Strategy, which was released in May 1998, provides a dynamic action plan that serves as a roadmap for a coordinated, effective, long-term attack on international crime.

Global organized crime activities are elusive because many global orgainzed crime groups operate through a variety of high tech means, which are difficult to trace. The groups operations have global implications such as illegal biological, nuclear, and chemical weapons trade.

La Cosa Nostra or LCN -- also known as the Mafia, the mob, the outfit, the office -- is a collection of Italian-American organized crime “families” that has been operating in the United States since the 1920s. For nearly three quarters of a century, beginning during the time of Prohibition and extending into the 1990s, the LCN was clearly the most prominent criminal organization in the U.S. Indeed, it was synonymous with organized crime. In recent years, the LCN has been severely crippled by law enforcement, and over the past decade has been challenged in a number of its criminal markets by other organized crime groups. Nevertheless, with respect to those criteria that best define the harm capacity of criminal organizations, it is still pre-eminent. The LCN has greater capacity to gain monopoly control over criminal markets, to use or threaten violence to maintain that control, and to corrupt law enforcement and the political system than does any of its competitors. As one eminent scholar has also pointed out, “no other criminal organization [in the United States] has controlled labor unions, organized employer cartels, operated as a rationalizing force in major industries, and functioned as a bridge between the upperworld and the underworld” (Jacobs, 1999:128). It is this capacity that distinguishes the LCN from all other criminal organizations in the U.S. James O. Finckenauer, Ph.D., National Institute of Justice.

The Canadian public is exposed to extensive media coverage of events related to organized crime (OC). Every day, an impressive array of stories appear in both print and broadcast media. A study carried out last year estimated at more than 27,000 the number of articles that referred to organized crime in 15 Canadian dailies and magazines over a six-year period (Beare & Ronderos, 2001). This massive exposure is significant, as the media are among the sources of information people count on to mould their opinion of the world around them. And with respect to crime, surveys have shown that up to 95% of people say they rely on the media as their primary source of information in this regard (Graber, 1979). Given the extensive OC media coverage here in Canada and its role as a possible source of public information in this regard, it seems imperative that we answer the following question: Does media coverage of OC-related events influence public opinion, and, if so, how?

Because of this emphasis on violence and sensationalism, the media often underplay organized crime activities with no apparent violence. The activities downplayed the most by the media, in terms of impact, are money laundering and economic crimes. Police managers also stated that the media give too much exposure to positive or socially acceptable events linked to organized crime. They consider, however, that police operations, trials and political interventions related to organized crime receive adequate and relatively proper coverage. Police managers are concerned about a lack of in-depth articles, editorials and feature stories that could provide an in-depth look at issues related organized crime. According to some managers, the biggest shortcoming is that the media never provide a comprehensive view of the actual causes and overall impact of organized crime in Canada.

In sum, the term "Asian Organized Crime" is handy but misleading, and while the esoterica surrounding Asian criminal organizations is immediately fascinating, the organizational structures alone are rather incidental to the phenomenon of crime as played out by ethnic Asians in the West.

http://www.nagia.org/Motorcycle_Gangs.htm
Once considered nothing more than rowdy toughs on two-wheelers, motorcycle gangs have evolved into crime units that are sufficiently well-oiled and well-organized to rival the Mafia. It's not just police officers who lump these groups together. Documented evidence in state, provincial and federal courts throughout the United States, Canada, Europe and Australia suggests that motorcycle gangs have become organized crime entities equal to the Mafia on many fronts. Biker gangs are organized internationally, with chapters in Europe, Australia, South America and Africa. As retired Illinois State Police Sergeant Joe Satercier noted in 1993 at a Chicago-area Outlaw Motorcycle Gang training seminar, "Biker gangs are the only sophisticated organized crime groups that we export from the United States."

http://www.sgc.gc.ca/publications/policing/1998orgcrim_e.asp
Over the past few years in Canada and around the world the topic of organized crime (OC) has attracted increased concern and attention. With this concern has come the need to better understand the phenomenon in its entirety. While many OC studies have been produced that describe or examine a particular OC activity or OC group, relatively little attention has been focused in any systematic way on the impact of OC on Canada, Canadians and their communities. The Organized Crime Impact Study (OCIS) addresses this issue. It does so not by focusing on OC groups but rather on the impact of key activities, such as the illicit drug trade, that organized criminals participate in and help sustain. Highlights from a study by Samuel Porteous for the Solicitor General Canada. The first attempt to measure the impact of organized crime on Canada.

The third section addresses the underground economy in the latter years of the Soviet Union as the framework from which the current Russian mafia, the subject of the fourth section, developed. The claim that Russia's problems with crime are merely an early stage of capitalism is addressed in the fifth section. A final section considers public policy approaches. Annelise Anderson.

Its reach extends into all fifteen of the former Soviet republics, across eleven time zones and one- sixth of the earth's land mass. It intrudes into every field of Western concern: the nascent free market, privatization, disarmament, military conversion, foreign humanitarian relief and financial aid, even state reserves of currency and gold.

Russian organized crime constitutes a direct threat to the national security interests of the United States by fostering instability in a nuclear-armed power. Left unchecked, Russia is in jeopardy of becoming a criminal syndicalist state under the control of corrupt government bureaucrats, politicians, quasi-businessmen, and criminals. Composed of senior-level U.S. government representatives and private-sector experts, the task force assesses the breadth and depth of Russian organized crime and corruption, addresses current U.S. policy, and makes recommendations on how best to confront these challenges.

It describes the fascination of the American press with all newly-emerging criminal enterprises and asks several functionalist questions concerning the possible ramifications of this interest.

Behind the pleasing facade of Asian restaurants, bakeries, herbal medicine drug stores, fresh produce markets and gift shops pandering to neighborhood residents and out-of-towners, street gang investigators in the past few years, have been tracking a major heroin trafficking rings involving the importation of multiple kilos of heroin brought into the neighborhood for resale on the street.

Intercontinental travel which used to require days or weeks now takes place in hours. The formerly daunting notion of conversing or conducting business with someone halfway around the globe is now a mouse-click or a telephone call away. This globalization has created a world virtually devoid of national borders.

A report by the United Kingdom National Criminal Intelligence Service on organized crime. (Last checked 06/15/04) United Kingdom Threat Assessment, 2001, Second Edition
http://www.ncis.co.uk/threat_assessment.html
This report gives a picture of serious criminal activity with organized crime groups (OCGs) involved in a diverse range of crime sectors, with the aim 'first and foremost to make money'. As well as traditional high-profile crimes such as drug-trafficking, robberty, extortion, theft and fraud, there is increasing concern over intellectual property theft (IPT) -- both in its own right and contributing to other criminality. The report draws attention to the sheer scale and complexity of counterfeiting -- especially of consumer goods - whether they are manufctured in the UK or in the cheap labor markets of the Far East. While UK Conterfeiting is often perceived as an activity by low level criminals, counterfeiting is, in fact, highly profitalbe and has a hevy involvement by organized criminals in the 'production, buying, importing and distribution of all types of counterefeited products'. The other misperception is that counterfeiting does not merit priority attention by law enforcement agencies but the report highlights that "the profits from IPT can help OCGs to become more established and to fund other various criminal activities'.

Hearing on Russian Organized Crime - 4/30/96 1996 Congressional Hearings Intelligence and Security
Statement of Louis J. Freeh Director FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION Before the House Committee on International Relations HEARING ON RUSSIAN ORGANIZED CRIME APRIL 30, 1996
Contents:
{Background}
The International Crime Problem
International Training
Interagency Working Group
Legal Attache Program
Grave crime is no longer bound by the constraints of borders. Such offenses as terrorism, nuclear smuggling, organized crime, computer crime, and drug trafficking can spill over from other countries into the United States. Regardless of origin, these and other overseas crimes impact directly on our citizens and our economy. We have developed a variety of anti-crime efforts both here and abroad to combat these dangerous threats. This effort has been undertaken with the support of the President, Attorney General Janet Reno, and Secretary Warren Christopher. One of the most effective ways to fight international crime is by building cop-to-cop bridges between American law enforcement and our overseas counterparts. Without these relationships, there cannot be the commonality of purpose and open communication required for success. More and more of these bridges are being built, and successes are flowing from them. We are using a number of approaches to develop cooperative law enforcement programs with other countries. For example, our Legal Attache Program works closely with a large number of foreign police forces. Not only do they cooperate on specific cases, but our Legal Attaches -- who are highly-skilled senior FBI Agents -- also form a sort of distant early warning system to alert us to new and emerging crime threats. Another very powerful tool is training: the FBI places a high priority on assisting our foreign law enforcement counterparts through training courses here and abroad. And just a year ago, we took a major cooperative step with other Federal agencies and other foreign nations with the creation of the International Law Enforcement Academy in Budapest. These and other programs combine to help give the FBI the critical foundation needed to effectively combat international crime. There is also another vital factor: I want to thank this Committee for its crucial recognition of the importance of these issues and for your support in meeting the crime challenges from abroad. This is a rare opportunity to extend the Rule of Law while mobilizing law enforcement to meet the explosion of international crime against America. I am exceedingly grateful for the support Congress has given us and pledge to continue to work with Congress as we develop a stronger global network of effective law enforcement. Your support of law enforcement training at the Department of State has been critical to the success of our programs. The International Crime Problem
The political, social, and economic changes occurring in Eastern Europe and in the former Soviet Republics have provided significant, unintended opportunities for organized crime groups and criminal enterprises in these countries to expand internationally. Evidence that organized crime activity from these areas is expanding and will continue to expand to the United States is well-documented. These criminal enterprises are not a new phenomenon to Russia. They existed under Communism. Appropriate legal tools were not created to control organized crime and corruption activities. When Communism declined in the Soviet Union, the organized crime groups quickly expanded their influence in the emerging move toward Capitalism, again because sufficient constraints and law enforcement tools were not present. The FBI has many years of successful investigative and prosecutorial experience in the battle with La Cosa Nostra and other organized crime groups here in the United States. We view organized crime as a continuing criminal conspiracy having a firm organizational structure, a conspiracy fed by fear and corruption. This definition can also be applied to the organized crime threat facing Russia and many other countries. Members of a typical Russian organized crime group are found at every level of society. Organized crime activity in Russia includes monetary speculation, manipulation of the banking system, and embezzlement of state property, as well as contract murder, extortion, drug trafficking, prostitution, protection rackets, and infiltration of legitimate business activity. To make matters worse, a number of Russian/Eurasian organized crime groups and criminal enterprises presently operate in the U.S. Many of these criminal enterprises active in the U.S. have demonstrated a willingness to work in close concert with other non-Russian/non-Eurasian organized crime groups. The United States and Russia fully realize the need for joint cooperation against crimes that harm both countries -- and other parts of the world as well. That is the reason the FBI has opened a Legal Attache Office in Moscow to work closely with Russian police against a variety of costly crimes. From July 1994 to the present, the number of cases worked by the FBI Agents in Moscow has increased from 20 to over 200. If Congress agrees, and with the cooperation of the Department of State and the Department of Justice, we hope to expand our network of Legal Attache Offices around the world. The global needs are great -- and many nations, including Russia, are working diligently to fight crime that hurts the law-abiding everywhere. One of the specific issues of great concern to the FBI and to Russian authorities is the theft and diversion of nuclear materials -- and the potential theft of nuclear weapons by terrorists or rogue nations. Over the past year, legitimate concerns have been raised by the apparent vulnerability of radioactive materials to theft or diversion in several areas of Eastern Europe and Eurasia. The seizure of significant amounts of cesium in Lithuania and the seizure of uranium in the Czech Republic are examples of the concerns in the international community regarding the threat of nuclear proliferation. The recent increases in radiological-nuclear material incidents throughout the world have caused the international law enforcement community to communicate better with each other. Although there have been no seizures of nuclear material in the United States, two recent cases involved conspiracies to import radioactive material into this country. In New York, the U.S. Customs Service arrested foreign nationals attempting to negotiate the sale of radioactive zirconium metal into the U.S. Ultimately, 45 tons of the material were seized in Cyprus, enroute to the U.S. In the other case, the Canadian Customs Service intercepted radioactive isotopes originating in Russia being smuggled into the U.S. through Canada. The FBI assisted the Canadian law enforcement agencies in their investigation. While some crime problems flow from East to West, others flow back from West to East. One of the most difficult law enforcement problems facing many of the newly-freed and Eastern European nations is drug trafficking. The scourge of drug trafficking has had a devastating impact on the entire global community. Russia, the Newly Independent States and Eastern Europe are certainly not immune to this epidemic. Criminal organizations in these emerging democracies are taking advantage of the relaxed borders and improved telecommunications systems that have emerged in recent years to facilitate their illegitimate operations. These countries are targets of opportunity for the major drug trafficking organizations, like the Colombian cartels, which seek to establish new and lucrative markets. International Training
The FBI's international approach in combating Russian and other international organized crime groups includes general and specialized law enforcement training for foreign law enforcement agencies. During Fiscal Year (FY) 1995, the FBI trained 4,400 foreign law enforcement personnel. This training is particularly critical with respect to the police agencies of some of the newly-emerging democracies. Most of this training is accomplished by funding generously made available by Congress to the Department of State through the Freedom Support Act (FSA) and Support for Eastern European Democracies (SEED) funding. The FBI and the Department of State, working together, are also responsible for the International Law Enforcement Training Academy in Budapest, which functions as the center for law enforcement training for officers from many Eastern European, Russian and Eurasian nations. The Academy at Budapest provides an eight-week professional development program similar to our FBI National Academy Program at Quantico. During FY 1995, a total of three classes graduated from the Budapest Academy -- each of 33 mid- level police officers. Those officers came from the Czech Republic, Hungary, Latvia, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Estonia, and Lithuania. For FY 1996, the schedule is much more aggressive, calling for approximately 200 persons to be trained from the following countries: Albania, Belarus, Bulgaria, Croatia, Estonia, Hungary, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Latvia, Macedonia, Moldova, Poland, Russia, Slovenia, and Ukraine. We can be immensely proud of the Academy at Budapest. It is a direct outgrowth of our trip to Eastern Europe in 1994 and President Clinton's direction to U.S. Government agencies to join together to build the world's capabilities in fighting international crime. The Academy represents the combined efforts of the Department of State (DOS), the Department of Justice (DOJ), the FBI, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), the United States Secret Service (USSS), the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center (FLETC), the Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms (ATF), and other agencies and countries. It is truly a case where all of these law enforcement agencies are working together as partners toward a common goal. I cannot speak highly enough about the contributions ATF, DEA, Secret Service, IRS and the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center in the Department of Treasury have made in making the Academy succeed. The Academy brings together seasoned investigators as instructors and law enforcement officers from across Eastern Europe, Russia, and the Newly Independent States to learn policing under the Rule of Law. I am especially grateful to our host country, Hungary. Just last week, I along with my other counterparts from the United States were honored to attend the dedication of the International Law Enforcement Academy. With the recent completion of renovations, the capacity of the Academy has been expanded. The dedication was an historic moment in international law enforcement. The FBI also is involved in foreign police training in many other valuable ways. For example, in FY 1995, the FBI performed a total of 10 In-Country Training Needs Assessments. It works this way: at the invitation of the host government, we analyze that country's police training needs and capabilities. We then make a recommendation of how we believe we can best assist the host country's law enforcement capabilities through specifically targeted training. The assessments were conducted in Albania, Belarus, Bulgaria, Estonia, India, Kazakhstan, Kyrgystan, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova, Paraguay, Peru, Poland, Romania, Tunisia, Ukraine, and Uruguay. Through the FBI's In-Country Training Program, the FBI conducts one and two-week schools in foreign nations which concentrate on police operations and technical skills. We use seasoned, senior FBI street Agent instructors who use their extensive practical experience in training our foreign counterparts in policing under the Rule of Law. The instructors in these programs have an established expertise in criminal investigations, especially organized crime and white collar crime. Their credibility is not only essential for effective instruction but also is very effective in building the cop-to-cop bridges that we so critically need. Since the first of the year, we have trained 212 officers of the Ministry of Interior for the Russian Federation (MVD) in seminars held in Russia and at the FBI Academy in Quantico. Along with the instruction geared to the investigation of crimes, we have provided training in ethics and internal police controls -- the first time that this has ever been done and an area which is critical to the success of policing under the Rule of Law. Our In-Country Training Programs are primarily funded through the FSA and SEED funds we receive from the Department of State. The FBI, along with other law enforcement agencies, submit proposed international training plans to the Department of State at the beginning of the Fiscal Year. Depending on the funding that is available for law enforcement training, the Department of State then determines the funding amounts for each agency. During the past two years, the FBI has received $8.3 million of these funds for our training initiative. We have been very pleased with the support we have received from the Department of State -- all the training we have proposed has been funded. In addition, the FBI has used $300,000 of its appropriated funding to provide limited training to law enforcement in other countries. In FY 1995, the FBI provided FSA and SEED supported training seminars to over 1,800 law enforcement officers from Hungary, Poland, Slovakia, Czech Republic, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Ukraine, Russia, Romania, and Moldova. In FY 1996, we will expand our training into Belarus, Slovenia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgystan, Bulgaria, and Albania. The training provided is tailored to meet the needs of the participants. Topics addressed include bank robbery, drug trafficking, kidnapping, financial crimes, white-collar crime, organized crime and terrorism. Just recently, for example, we conducted a white-collar crime and corruption seminar in Kazakhstan. All of this training has a direct impact on United States persons and corporations who have flocked to these countries in search of business opportunities. In addition to the training funded by the FSA and SEED Acts, the FBI trained an additional 2,600 students through our other programs. These programs included the crime-specific investigative seminars, targeted crime scene analysis training as provided by our forensic experts, and management training for mid-level and executive law enforcement officers. Last year, 110 international officers also participated in the FBI National Academy program at Quantico. Their participation allows an additional "bridge" to be built from our state and local officers to those overseas. One beneficial part of this training is the opportunity it provides the trainers and the trainees to interact about specific crime problems being encountered in their countries, how to address the problem, share experiences learned in the process and forge new relationships for future cooperation on matters of mutual interest and concern. In some of our investigations, the FBI has benefitted by bringing actual case investigators to the U.S. from other nations to work side by side with FBI Agents. This is a continuation of the training we have provided and allows "hands-on" application and observation of investigative techniques successfully employed by the FBI in our organized crime investigations. As examples of the successes the FBI has seen from contacts and liaison established as a result of this training, a Central European working group on international organized crime and a six-nation working group on international organized crime were established this past year. In addition to the FBI, they bring together law enforcement agencies from Eastern and Western Europe and Canada to discuss specific organized crime threats common to all countries represented. Lines of communication and working relationships are now established and practical law enforcement approaches to the organized crime problems of the regions are planned. As a direct result of this initiative, several countries were, for the first time, able to establish continuing liaison communications with other represented organizations on a direct professional level and to initiate joint investigations. For example, a multi-national, case-specific fraud seminar was conducted by the FBI's Financial Crimes Section from February 18-22, 1996, in Berlin, Germany. The program dealt with bank failures and brought together investigators from the United States, Latvia, Netherlands, Russia, and Germany for a practical case training initiative. The resulting product of these constructive meetings is an investigative organized crime task force, international in scope, that is targeting significant criminal organizations determined to be a major threat to many nations, including the United States. The FBI also presented a nuclear non-proliferation conference at the FBI complex at Quantico, Virginia from April 18-21, 1995, and twenty-eight (28) SEED and FSA nations sent representatives, including, among others, Russia and Ukraine. The conference outlined the problems of nuclear materials and weapons proliferation from the countries of the former Soviet Union and counter-proliferation proposals and training initiatives. The conference is included as a FSA initiative to address this serious problem. The Department of Defense and the FBI are currently in the final stages of submitting the DOD/FBI Counterproliferation Program report to Congress regarding plans to provide international training seminars on nuclear smuggling. This is part of our Nunn-Lugar funded international training seminars program on nuclear smuggling. The FBI's Nuclear Biological Chemical Proliferation Unit is presently in possession of a report compiled by an FBI team that recently conducted a training assessment in the Czech Republic. During this assessment, which was coordinated by our Legal Attache in Vienna, the FBI representatives from the International Coordination Unit, the FBI Laboratory and the Engineering Section, met with various Czech law enforcement agencies, Czech nuclear safety officials, and faculty members of the Rez Institute. This assessment yielded valuable information regarding the concerns and needs of the attending Czech officials. It is proposed that the information provided by the Czechs, with regard to their specific requirements, will result in establishing a training prototype for other countries requesting support in counterproliferation matters. Interagency Working Group
As this Committee is fully aware, the Congress established the Interagency Working Group (IWG) to make recommendations as to training and other support received by Russia, the Newly Independent States, and other Eastern European countries. This has been a successful endeavor that greatly assists us in the proper coordination of our training efforts abroad. The IWG allows all Federal law enforcement agencies to participate in Department of State FSA and SEED funded training initiatives within the former Soviet Union and Bloc nations, based on their respective law enforcement jurisdiction. Participation in the IWG prevents duplication and waste of resources. IWG priorities are formulated by the Departments of State, Justice and the Treasury, as dictated by the various law enforcement entities from those departments, participating on the IWG. The FBI participates as a member of the IWG in carrying out the programs under the auspices of the FSA and SEED. Let me describe the FBI's role: The FBI, as the agency with the broadest Federal law enforcement responsibility, conducted a major portion of the training and technical assistance during FY 1995, with a similar schedule planned for FY 1996. The FBI has exclusive training in the area of organized crime. Other participating agencies like the Drug Enforcement Administration and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms, likewise have exclusive areas of training based on their expertise and jurisdiction. In other areas, such as economic crimes, training by the United States Secret Service, U.S. Customs Service, FINCEN, and DEA compliments that done by the FBI. Legal Attache Program
The FBI's Legal Attache Program is the single most significant factor in the Bureau's ability to detect, deter, and investigate international crimes in which the United States or our citizens are the victims. By stationing Agents abroad and establishing operational links with foreign police, the FBI substantially expands the nation's perimeter of law enforcement protection. Generously funded out of the Commerce, State, and Justice Bill, the FBI's Legal Attaches are truly our first line of defense. International crime has grown enormously in recent years. Technological advances and the end of the Cold War prompted dramatic increases in global travel and telecommunications. Criminals have used these changes to their advantage, diffusing their operations around the world to avoid law enforcement scrutiny. The relentless globalization of crime threatens America both at home and abroad -- and all other law-abiding nations as well. For better or for worse, the global village is now a late-20th century reality. Our experience shows that placing FBI Agents at critical posts abroad provides the most reliable, effective and timely means to combat international crime -- and often at the source. It is essential to station highly-skilled agents in other countries to prevent foreign terrorism and foreign crime from reaching the United States. At present, the FBI has in place in our Legal Attache Offices 70 senior Agents and 54 support personnel in 23 nations around the world, funded out of FBI operational funds. During FY 1995, these offices handled over 11,200 matters. They are the conduit through which law enforcement information and cooperation flows between the United States and its foreign partners. Their goal can be defined succinctly: to keep foreign crime as far from American shores as possible, to keep foreign crime permanently at bay whenever possible, to help combat more effectively those crimes that do reach our borders. The whole point is to protect the American people from harm. FBI Agents stationed overseas are not intelligence officers; they are not a shadow intelligence agency; and they do not engage in espionage. They are law enforcement Agents-- dedicated to fighting organized crime, terrorism, nuclear smuggling, violent crime, drug trafficking, and economic crime. Let me give a few examples of the direct benefits made possible because our agents are overseas and have the cop-to-cop relationships with host authorities critical to effective law enforcement. For over 15 years, FBI Agents in Rome have had a close working relationship with all the major Italian police services. Through one joint investigation which began in 1991, it was determined that members of the Sicilian Mafia, Camorra, and 'Ndrangheta were collaborating with the Colombian drug cartels in shipments of cocaine to Italy and heroin into New York. In that investigation -- which utilized sophisticated investigative techniques, including electronic surveillance -- the FBI worked closely with the Italian police services, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, and Colombian judicial authorities. As a result of our combined efforts, 89 people were arrested in the United States, Italy, Canada, and Colombia. Since their arrests, 30 of these people have been convicted in the United States alone. Kobi Mowatt, a fugitive from the United States, was recently arrested in Tanzania with assistance from our FBI Legal Attaches. Mowatt, an alleged member of the notoriously violent "First and Kennedy Street Crew," from Washington, D.C., is charged with conspiring to participate in a racketeering organization by committing acts of murder, robbery, kidnapping, and drug dealing. He was charged in a 53-count indictment with participating in four homicides, including a triple murder here in Washington in 1994. With direct assistance from our Legal Attaches, and the considerable assistance of foreign police agencies, the FBI was able to track Mowatt through Russia until his capture in Tanzania. Last month, he was brought back to the United States to stand trial. In a major move against a growing Russian organized crime structure in the United States, the FBI last year arrested Vyacheslav Kirillovich Ivankov, allegedly one of the most powerful Russian crime leaders in this country, along with five of his associates on Federal charges of conspiracy to commit extortion. The arrests in New York followed an intensive FBI investigation that was aided greatly by the Russian Ministry of Interior and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and made possible because of our Legal Attaches and the relationships that have flowed from cooperation abroad. The arrest was based upon Federal arrest warrants which charge a total of nine individuals. According to Russian law enforcement authorities, Ivankov formed a substantial criminal organization in Russia before he entered the United States allegedly to manage and control Russian organized crime activities in this country. Russian organized crime groups use businesses in the former Soviet Union, Western and Central Europe, and the United States to serve as fronts for laundering the proceeds of illegal activities and for conducting highly profitable commerce in goods in the successor states of the Soviet Union, known as the Commonwealth of Independent States. In November 1994, several of the defendants allegedly began to extort several million dollars from American and Russian businesses. Intelligence information was shared on a continuing basis among the FBI, the Russian MVD and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. FBI Legat participation was critical. Last August, Eyad Ismail was apprehended abroad and brought back to New York to face an indictment charging him with taking part in the terrorist bombing of the World Trade Center that killed six people and injured over 1,000. As the complaint alleged, Ismail fled the United States the night of the bombing. He was taken into custody after an extensive investigation greatly facilitated by an FBI Legal Attache. Last April, Ramzi Yousef and Abdul Hakim Murad were indicted in New York for a conspiracy and attempt to bomb United States commercial airlines serving air routes in the Far East. The indictment alleges that as part of the conspiracy, Yousef placed a bomb in a foreign airliner that exploded and killed one passenger. Yousef was already facing charges relating to the bombing of the World Trade Center in New York. With critical assistance from FBI Legal Attaches, Yousef was tracked to Pakistan, apprehended, and extradited to the United States to stand trial. Murad was identified and likewise extradited to the United States. Both await trial. Most recently, four Russians were charged in New York for conspiring to defraud 24 Russian companies, including a charity established to aid the victims of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster, of approximately $10.8 million. Many other important cases have been made possible only because the FBI Legal Attaches are able to freely work with our foreign counterparts toward the mutually-shared goal of effective law enforcement under the Rule of Law. The FBI is deeply grateful to Congress for the support and contributions for our Legal Attache Program. A relatively few Agents beyond our borders make a contribution out of proportion to their small numbers and the modest amount of dollars spent. As part of the FY 1996 Appropriations process, our Appropriations Subcommittees have asked us to prepare a plan reflecting our assessment of both the short and long-term Legal Attache expansion needs. We have been working closely with the Departments of Justice and State to provide Congress with a carefully thought-out plan designed to better meet the challenges we face from exploding international crime and terrorism. This plan -- which is under final administrative review -- is a realistic, down-to-earth assessment of the vast changes that have occurred in recent years in the world, especially in Europe with the breakup of the former Soviet Union. I am most grateful to our House and Senate Committees for their leadership. Quite candidly, Congress has taken planning for FBI Legal Attache Offices out of the choppy one-year cycle and prompted us to develop a long-term, comprehensive response to a rapidly changing and worsening international crime situation. Once completed, I am looking forward to discussing the plan with Congress. I am extraordinarily grateful for the support Congress has given these programs. In my view, this represents capitalizing on a rare opportunity to protect our citizens by being both prepared and sufficiently aggressive as crime moves into the global arena. At the same time, I wish to thank the Department of State and Secretary Christopher for supporting the FBI's foreign police training efforts and for their leadership on the IWG. Since my trip to Moscow and Eastern Europe in 1994 we have had an ongoing and productive dialogue about our training initiatives -- indeed, an extraordinary partnership has formed. In addition to Secretary Christopher, Deputy Secretary Strobe Talbott, former Assistant Secretary Richard Holbrooke, Ambassador Robert Gelbard, U.S. Ambassador to Hungary Donald Blinken, and many others -- both here and abroad -- have been instrumental in promoting these programs.

GLOBAL ORGANIZED CRIME AS A THREAT TO NATIONAL SECURITY
Global Organized Crime in the Post-Cold War Era
Since the end of the Cold War and the subsequent refocusing of Intelligence away from the Soviet Union, Global Organized Crime has been recognized as a priority threat to national security. Global Organized Crime has been defined by FBI Director Louis J. Freeh as "a continuing criminal conspiracy having a firm organizational structure, a conspiracy fed by fear and corruption." The international crimes that extend over foreign borders and into the United States include drug trafficking, extortion, money laundering, arms smuggling, bribery, and fraud schemes. In recent years these criminal groups have dramatically increased the scope of their activities by taking advantage of many Post-Cold War opportunities such as the lowering of economic and political barriers; the end of communist regimes and the founding of fragile new democracies; the increase in legitimate international trade; and the advances in technology that facilitate global communication and transport. The Administration, Intelligence and Law Enforcement have reacted to the new organized crime groups, emerging on a global scale after the Cold War, by creating a strong national response. The current system is not "broken." However, the threat itself is growing in terms of its scale and complexity at a such a fast rate that it is important to look at possible ways in which the national response to Global Organized Crime can be improved. In order to understand the significance of improving current policy and national efforts against Global Organized Crime, the changing nature and seriousness of the threat must first be understood. The Changing Threats
Emerging threats vs. Familiar problems
Global Organized Crime in the Post-Cold War Era pose some familiar national security threats and some threats that United States did not previously have to address. The security concerns that existed during the Cold War include: political instability of foreign governments, international drug trafficking and arms transfers to hostile parties. Global criminal leaders present new puzzles within these familiar threats. Former Director of the CIA, R. James Woolsey, described the difficulties of applying traditional national security methods when addressing Global Organized Crime, ...the tools of diplomacy are ineffective and irrelevant in dealing directly with these criminal groups. Even under the most difficult, intractable period of the Cold War, if consensus was not possible, communication was, nevertheless, feasible. Not so in the world of organized crime. Although we do negotiate with our key allies and friends to better attack the problem, there is no negotiating table where we can try to work out a compromise or reach a consensus with criminals.... In addition, certain distinctions can be made between Global Organized Crime and terrorism. While many terrorist groups that engage in violent acts are motivated by specific political causes, such as Egyptian Islamic Fundamentalist terrorists who use violent means to protest their country's current government and Western influences, most organized crime groups are only interested in political power for the security it would provide their organization and are primary motived by money. The international economic threat, posed by Global Organized Crime, in an increasingly global economy is among the major "new" threats to national security. The major economic powers and the less developed nations did not previously share a collective problem of this nature. Global Organized Crime does not just affect a select group of financial institutions or regional areas, it affects international financial networks and economies at a national level. These threats present new conflicts that will require innovative strategies in the future. Global Cooperation among Organized Crime Groups Cooperation among Global Organized Crime groups has increased as restrictions have lessened between international borders. These foreign havens for criminals and their assets have made it increasingly difficult for Law Enforcement to trace illegal profits; gather evidence on the criminal leaders; and identify and contain criminal groups. When Law Enforcement activities in Florida reduced the amount of Colombian cocaine being smuggled into the U.S. through the Carribean islands, the Colombian drug cartel leaders simply began working with their Mexican counterparts instead of their Carribean partners. Another example of an international partnership is Columbian drug lords selling methamphetamine to American dealers in the U.S., the ingredients for which were produced through Colombian connections to organized crime in Europe, Asia and the Far East. These global networks allow organized crime groups to greatly increase the profits of their operations and their methods of evading local governments as they share information, skills, costs, market access and relative strengths. Threat to Global Economy
Transnational organized crime groups pose more of a threat to international financial markets as the world economy becomes increasingly interdependent. Laundering billions of dollars in organized crime money worsens national debt problems because the large sums of money are then lost as tax revenue to that country's government. Russian organized crime groups are actively involved in banking, according to FBI official James Moody, because public financial institutions are "the most vulnerable and lucrative target." The Russian Interior Ministry has estimated that organized crime "controls" most of Russia's 200 banks and half of its financial capital ("control" ranges from ownership and operation to influence over bank decisions through threats of violence). U.S. and Western businesses in Russia, in particular, are frequent targets of extortion, robberies, threats and murder. Security costs for these businesses (especially physical protection, extra protection of cargo, and forced payments to gangsters for "protection,") often consume more than 30% of profits. The fear generated combined with organized crime monopolies in certain industries, such as the agriculture and construction markets in Columbia and Venezuela, damages the overall economy because it discourages legitimate, innovative businesses and entrepreneurs (foreign and domestic) from entering the market. Political Impact
Global Organized Crime can have a damaging effect on political structures, especially the fragile new systems of government found in the former communist or totalitarian regimes. South American drug cartels have a destabilizing effect on governments through their financial support of local guerilla rebels, such as the Sendero Luminoso in Peru and the Revolutionary Armed Forces in Columbia, who share their animosity toward the government and who exchange protection for money and arms supplies. The Sicilian Mafia have used their economic power over local businesses and banks and their supplies of cash to corrupt politicians, judges and Law Enforcement, assassinating many of those public figures who will not cooperate. Media polls indicate that the many Russians believe the "mafiya" is more powerful than the government. As people feel that the government is powerless to stop organized crime, they turn to crime leaders for protection and political institutions begin to deteriorate. Fear of organized crime undermines the credibility of political reform and may encourage support for anti-democratic, hardline politicians such as Russia's Vladimir Zhirinovsky who promised during the 1993 campaign to end organized crime in 3 months through mass arrest and execution. The Potential for a Major Nuclear/Arms Theat The global networks of criminals, terrorists and corrupt government officials and their complex methods of smuggling goods could easily be transferred to the smuggling of nuclear materials on a massive scale. While Global Organized Crime has become increasingly more involved in the transfer of arms, encouraged in part by conflicts in the Balkans and former Soviet Union which proved to be profitable for the Russian and Italian mafia, the smuggling of nuclear materials seems to be currently isolated to select incidents and mostly to amateurs. Russia no longer has the nuclear materials protection that it had during the Cold War when materials were controlled by a tight, centralized system under a politically powerful government. In the past year, the FBI has seized major shipments of nuclear materials in Eastern Europe, including large seizures of cesium in Lithuania and uranium in the Czech Republic. As Global Organized Crime groups become more powerful and as nuclear materials become more vulnerable (through poor management, underpaid desperate workers in the nuclear facilities, and government corruption) the threat becomes more serious. Damage to Society caused by International Drug Trafficking International drug trafficking poses a threat to the social fabric of all countries. The increase in the scale of these operations has led to an increase in drug use, addiction, and general crime level. The common U.S.-Mexico border alone causes a tremendous increase in the American drug problem: 60-70% of cocaine in the U.S. enters at this border through a Mexican-Columbian organized crime partnership. Other European organized crime groups use this border to transport heroin, marijuana, and methamphetamine. It is becoming increasingly difficult to track the flow of narcotics into the United States as the drug cartel methods become more technically sophisticated: redesigning the interiors of Boeing 727s to hold maximum amounts of cocaine; transferring drug profits electronically to dozens of banks around the world in less than 24 hours; and using falsified export documents and invoices for goods in order to disguise drug trafficking transactions. THE CURRENT NATIONAL RESPONSE TO GLOBAL ORGANIZED CRIME
The Administration
President Clinton and the current administration have acknowledged the threat of Global Organized Crime by supporting new anti-crime legislation and by highlighting the issue in public forums. Reducing transnational crime, according to President Clinton, is a part of the challenge of "making sure America remains the strongest force in the world for peace and freedom, security and prosperity" as it enters the 21st century. Presidential Decision Directive-42 (PDD-42), created by President Clinton, recognizes that Global Organized Crime is a threat to national security. The directive orders government agencies to "use creatively and aggressively all legal means to combat international organized crime,"creates the authority to deny visas to a broad range of organized criminals, and sanctions authority against governments that cooperate with or provide sanctuary to organized crime figures. While PDD- 42 brought public attention to the issue of international organized crime, it did not expand or change current policy. President Clinton merely highlighted the topic with PDD-42 and repeated older policy. In comparison, PDD-35 may prove to have a significant effect on the threat because it will affect the amount of Intelligence resources devoted to global crime. PDD- 35, which defines intelligence requirements, declares that intelligence collection and analysis of international criminal and drug activities should be a high priority. The President has also actively supported the International Crime Control Act of 1996 which addresses Global Organized Crime with measures that include expanding the definitions of money laundering, eliminating the statute of limitations for all federal criminal offenses committed outside of the United States and encourages global cooperation among governments through joint-law enforcement programs. The Act will provide U.S. Law Enforcement with a little more flexibility overseas in their investigations and arrests of international criminals. It is possible for the President to lead a government-wide initiative against a new security threat. In the late 1940's, the U.S. developed a strategy for containing Soviet sponsored communism. This unified plan of action included the Marshall Plan, military build-up, development of long-standing alliances (especially NATO), public diplomacy efforts to rebuild foreign democracies and the focusing of the Intelligence Community on the problem. The Post-Cold War Era has a different world context, but the successful strategy can still serve as a model for intergovernmental cooperation. Law Enforcement and Intelligence
Different Perspectives on Global Organized Crime
Containing organized crime traditionally has been the domain of law enforcement agencies while addressing national security concerns has been primarily the field of the Intelligence Community. Transnational crime blurs the line between "domestic" and "foreign" affairs because the criminals have a global impact: they are based in foreign countries, but have international ties, including many in the United States. The Law Enforcement perspective on Global Organized Crime is that it is a major cause in the increasing domestic and international crime levels. Law Enforcement seeks to reduce global crime through arrests and successful prosecutions of the international organized crime leaders. The Intelligence perspective examines global crime in terms of its political and economic impact overseas and as a threat to national security. Intelligence agencies pursue information on Global Organized Crime that will assist Law Enforcement in their investigations but are primarily concerned with providing policy-makers with global crime intelligence. The differing perspectives on Global Organized Crime reveals larger differences between Law Enforcement and Intelligence. Since the Law Enforcement mission is to enforce the law and provide information to court trials that will establish proof beyond a reasonable doubt, they are acutely sensitive to evidentiary requirements when collecting information. Intelligence agencies, because of their mission to provide policy-makers with relevant national security intelligence, collect information for their own analysis and are more concerned with preserving their sources than placing them under the public scrutiny of trials. Generations of Law Enforcement and Intelligence officials working for different missions have resulted in a mutual distrust of working together; while Intelligence worries about protecting its sources and methods when assisting a criminal investigation, Law Enforcement is concerned about protecting their evidence. The Law Enforcement Approach
The Department of Justice seeks to reduce Global Organized Crime by presenting a strong Law Enforcement presence overseas. In recent years, FBI Legal Attache offices alone have grown to 70 Senior Agents in 23 countries. The Legal Attache program works closely with foreign police on specific cases and acts as a "distant early warning system" to alert the FBI of emerging crime threats. Director Freeh has focused on "building cop-to-cop bridges between American law enforcement and our overseas counterparts" and views this as being the most effective means of fighting international crime. The FBI programs in the U.S. and overseas that train foreign law enforcement officers are a central element of this partnership. The model for global cooperation through training is the recent creation of the International Law Enforcement Academy in Budapest. Although the FBI has been successful in building an increasingly extensive network of police force partnerships, the Law Enforcement approach to Global Organized Crime does have its limitations. Director Freeh has suggested that "such international law enforcement problems are not solved by merely an intelligence community response. It is not a matter of spy- counterspy. Instead, it requires a law enforcement response..." Despite Director Freeh's persuasive arguments, there are certain obstacles for a law enforcement response. Collecting evidence beyond a reasonable doubt in Global Organized Crime cases is more difficult because the international networks allow criminals to hide their tracks in different bank accounts, partners, and storage areas around the world. The overall effectiveness of prosecuting these criminals is also questionable in cases when a crime leader is brought to trial, and his organization simply promotes a different criminal to that position in order to continue with its operations. The Intelligence Approach
As part of its new role addressing non-traditional threats of the Post-Cold War Era, Intelligence makes contributions of Global Organized Crime information to Law Enforcement and policy-makers. Former DCI John Deutch redirected the Intelligence Community's resources and activities toward assisting Law Enforcement to "identify, target and apprehend" criminals engaged in illegal trafficking and smuggling. The CIA has reorganized the Director of Central Intelligence's Counter-Narcotics Center into the DCI Crime and Narcotics Center. The new center has tried to provide greater opportunities for law enforcement agencies to gain "actionable intelligence" on specific global crime groups. According to David Carey, Director of the DCI Crime and Narcotics Center, intelligence collection has been primarily directed at the structure of international crime networks and the political and economic impact of the threat. HUMINT (Human-Source Intelligence) has proven to be the most effective Intelligence discipline in collecting information on global crime. In SIRs prepared at the request of the DCI and under the auspices of the National Intelligence Council, HUMINT was graded as being critically more important for narcotics intelligence than all other intelligence disciplines put together. The global networks of organized crime groups interacting with other criminal groups, terrorists and corrupt officials, are not easily observed using the technical methods that were successfully employed for national security concerns during the Cold War. They can, however, be penetrated by human sources. Human agents, through their internal access to the criminal groups, provide information on future dangers and weaknesses of the criminal networks, and without the use of covert action, disrupt and isolate international criminal groups by allowing Intelligence to place them under intense scrutiny. Although the National Security Act of 1947 prohibits the CIA from having domestic Law Enforcement powers, the CIA continues to be involved in Global Organized Crime cases that have domestic elements. Many transnational criminals have connections to American citizens and operate parts of their organization in the United States. For example, over 200 of Russia's estimated 6000 organized crime groups operate with American counterparts in 17 U.S. cities spread out across 14 states. Reagan's Executive Order 12333 clarifies CIA statutory authority in this area by authorizing the CIA to "participate in law enforcement activities to investigate or prevent clandestine intelligence activities by foreign powers or international terrorist or narcotics activity." Cooperation with Law Enforcement allows the CIA to remain active in cases with domestic elements. The CIA, under E.O. 12333, participates in the international aspects of the global crime case and Law Enforcement then handles the domestic aspects that involve U.S. citizens or other areas of domestic involvement. Cooperation Between Intelligence and Law Enforcement Problems in coordinating overseas activities between Intelligence and Law Enforcement have resulted from the greatly increasing number of overseas Justice Department agents (especially FBI), overlapping responsibilities, lack of a clear hierarchy for coordination, different missions and concerns over the risks involved in cases. Law Enforcement agencies alone have problems with inefficient overlap and interference of cases. In April 1992, five Law Enforcement agencies had duplicating analysis of drug smuggling movement by air into Mexico. There is controversy over Law Enforcement coordinating activities with the Ambassador although it is required by law to do so (22 U.S. C. 3927). Law Enforcement expresses interest in keeping the Ambassador informed of its activities but is reluctant to involve him in prosecutorial decisions. On an inconsistent basis, Law Enforcement coordinates the recruitment of confidential informants overseas with the Chief of Station. Although the Chief of Station and Law Enforcement representative are under the authority of the Embassy, there is not a clear hierarchy or set of guide-lines for coordinating activities. Since there is not a single individual or group to organize individual activities, the FBI often acts independently of Intelligence and vice versa. Intelligence and Law Enforcement, from worker to director levels of authority, have created projects to improve coordination between the communities. A special task force is trying to clarify guidelines for cooperation between Intelligence and Law Enforcement overseas. A Joint Intelligence Community-Law Enforcement (JICLE) working group (comprised of lawyers and officials from both sides) was created in 1995 and meets on a weekly basis to help devise solutions to common problems. The recommendations of the JICLE have included Intelligence- Law Enforcement training programs that overcome mission and community culture barriers through education on the laws, regulations, and procedures that facilitate coordination. The new Transnational Threats Committee of the NSC, which includes the DCI and the Attorney General, provides the first formal opportunity for overseas coordination problems to be solved at the highest levels of authority. Global Cooperation
Law Enforcement and Intelligence have found that international cooperation is one of the most effective solutions to transnational problems. The Law Enforcement Community has made significant advances in global cooperation through delegations of American law enforcement leaders visiting foreign counterparts, cooperative criminal investigations, and training programs for foreign Law Enforcement. The Aspin-Brown Commission found that Intelligence derived great benefit from such cooperative arrangements as: exchanging requests for collection; exchanging analysts and technicians; and assisting foreign countries to acquire collection capabilities in order to share the results of future collections. While U.S. Intelligence Community might not want to pursue a thorough "spy-to-spy" method analogous to FBI Director Freeh's "cop-to-cop" approach (due to the inherent risks to sources and methods), the IC still needs to continue global cooperation efforts. In many cases, global cooperation is worth the risk because it provides access to geography, skills, contacts and information that would be otherwise unavailable. ALTERNATIVES TO CURRENT POLICY TOWARD GLOBAL ORGANIZED CRIME
Direction from the Administration
The Aspin-Brown Commission's Preparing for the 21st Century: An Appraisal of U.S. Intelligence recommends that the President by Executive Order reaffirm that global criminal activities are national security matters and require a multi-agency response. The recommendation further suggests that "a law enforcement approach is inadequate." If implemented, this recommendation would have almost zero costs and obstacles but would create little improvement on the present situation by providing no additional funds, manpower or plans for action. The President has already recognized these issues in PDD-35, PDD-42 and through his support for the International Crime Control Act of 1996. The additional Executive Order would not contribute significantly to the reform effort. Legislative Boundaries
The Aspin-Brown Commission recommends an E.O. that would clarify that intelligence agencies with collection capabilities may collect information about non-U.S. persons outside the United States at the request of Law Enforcement. The Commission does not specify if Intelligence would participate based on its own volition and if Law Enforcement could actually task Intelligence. "Tasking," as opposed to "requesting information," would imply a certain amount of Law Enforcement control over Intelligence during the case. The recommendation would basically leave the situation as it is currently but would officially recognize the legality of Intelligence agencies collecting for Law Enforcement. There is a reluctance on the part of the Intelligence Community to accept direct collection requests from law enforcement agencies. NSA and CIA refuse to be directly tasked by Law Enforcement and will only proceed with a collection request on a specific target if they first determine that there is a "foreign intelligence" purpose. This formal requirement is often a mere procedural formality because most requests are determined to be relevant to foreign intelligence. Unfortunately, the requirement can also create tension between the two communities by fostering the perception that Intelligence is unwilling to assist Law Enforcement. Instead of the President creating an E.O., the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal year 1997( IAA97) responded to the Aspin-Brown recommendation with an amendment to the National Security Act of 1947 that clarifies Intelligence assistance to Law Enforcement. Section 105A states "elements of the intelligence community may, upon the request of a United States law enforcement agency, collect information outside the United States about individuals who are not United States persons." The careful wording still implies that Intelligence will participate based on its own volition. If it had been phrased as "Law Enforcement may request that...", it would have had slightly different connotations. As it is currently written, it follows the Aspin-Brown model, and officially authorizes the current Intelligence-Law Enforcement collection procedures without trying to significantly improve them. The amendment, as it was recommended by the Commission, will provide some benefits to Law Enforcement and Intelligence cooperation and will have little costs. The CIA and NSA will benefit by collecting for Law Enforcement with less concern about their legal authorities being questioned. Law Enforcement will benefit from a probable increase in collection requests that are answered. In evading the more controversial question of collection responsibilities and overseas tasking, the Aspin-Brown recommendation and IAA97 also had fewer implementation obstacles. The House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence's IC21: Intelligence Community in the 21st Century recommend that no additional clarifications of the law be made in terms of coordination and cooperation between Law Enforcement and Intelligence. They suggested that there is already enough flexibility and a workable set of legal boundaries in the current laws and standing Executive Orders. E.O. 12333 provides reasonably flexible boundaries for Intelligence assisting Law Enforcement in international criminal cases. Despite these arguments a clarification of the law, as the Aspin-Brown Commission recommended and IAA97 created, still provided some benefits. Lack of precise legal authorities can hamper, delay or side-track cooperation and communication efforts between the two communities. Coordination between Law Enforcement and Intelligence
Global Crime Committee The Aspin-Brown Commission, HPSCI and the Council on Foreign Relations reports agree that the Intelligence and the Law Enforcement Communities need a better mechanism for finding solutions to disagreements and for forming cohesive strategies. The Aspin-Brown Commission recommends that the President create by Executive Order a Global Crime Committee of the National Security Council to direct the U.S. actions against transnational security threats. The committee would be chaired by the National Security Advisor and the core members would include the Director of Central Intelligence, the Attorney General, and the Secretaries of State and Defense. Unfortunately, the Secretary of Treasury is not included among the core members even though his input would be important when the Committee discussed such transnational threats as financial crimes and illegal smuggling. The new committee would identify specific transnational groups that require a coordinated response; establish an overall strategy and monitor its implementation; develop improved procedures for sharing relevant information between the two communities; and develop guidelines to govern the coordination of law enforcement overseas. The recommendation for the creation of this committee is the one of the most significant efforts by the intelligence reform reports to improve the national strategy toward Global Organized Crime. Instead of the President using an Executive Order, Congress responded to the Aspin- Brown Commission's recommendation by creating the Committee on Transnational Threats, under section 804 of the Intelligence Authorization Act of FY 1997. With the exception of the committee's name and a few minor differences, the new Committee follows the model created by the Commission in their recommendation. Unlike the Transnational Threats Committee, previous Intelligence and Law Enforcement working groups, task forces and meetings were not held at a director level, and were not focused on forming a national strategy but rather on resolving individual conflicts between the communities. The Aspin-Brown recommendation succeeded in convincing the Congressional committees to create the Transnational Threat Committee but the real obstacle remains insuring that the directors actually use this opportunity to forge better cooperation instead of a superficial collaboration. The major cost of the committee is pulling already busy leaders away from other activities. The potential benefits of improving the national approach toward global crime will outweigh the costs. The Committee, as it was modeled after the Commission's recommendation, blends all international criminal threats into one label of "global crime" or "transnational threats." While some of the security and diplomacy issues are similar, Global Organized Crime and terrorist groups have different organizational networks, agendas, and weaknesses. They also pose different economic and political threats. While the Transnational Threats Committee will address both of these issues, it should be aware that strategies that are responsive to the differences in Global Organized Crime and terrorism will be more effective in reducing each threat. Single Law Enforcement Representative The Aspin-Brown Commission recommends that the President designate the Attorney General as the focal point and spokesperson for formulating the Law Enforcement strategy for global crime, facilitating cooperation with Intelligence and coordinating overseas Law Enforcement activities. Currently, Law Enforcement responsibility is split between the Attorney General (whose department includes FBI, DEA and INS) and the Secretary of Treasury (whose department includes Secret Service, Customs Service, and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms). The majority of Global Organized Crime issues fall under the Attorney General's responsibilities but Global Organized Crime cases that involve smuggling goods into the U.S., money laundering and other financial crimes, fall under the jurisdiction of the Secretary of Treasury. They should both be included in forming national strategies and in representing Law Enforcement as they direct departments with different responsibilities and resources. The additional Treasury perspective provides more significant benefits than the gain in efficiency that a single representative would provide. The HPSCI report similarly opposes the Attorney General acting as the single representative or the FBI acting as the lead agency of Law Enforcement. HPSCI argues that it would be a mistake to ignore overseas law enforcement agencies outside of the Justice Department. This is an important recommendation because while the FBI has provided innovative solutions to global crime and should continue to be active in influencing the improvement of the overall law enforcement strategy, it is not the only agency involved in overseas activities. Priority in the National Strategy and Coordination
Since effective coordination requires strong leadership, the Aspin-Brown Commission and the Council on Foreign Relations Report suggest that a coordinated national effort against global crime would benefit from Intelligence taking priority over Law Enforcement. According to the Aspin-Brown Commission, in order to coordinate daily activities overseas, Law Enforcement should play a subordinate role under the Ambassador and the Chief of Station. However, HPSCI argues against Intelligence taking immediate priority over Law Enforcement and only recommends that the Chief of Station and the Ambassador be "kept reasonably informed of law enforcement objectives and plans." While Intelligence agencies can make a significant contribution to policy-makers forming decisions on Global Organized Crime, they should not necessarily be given priority over Law Enforcement. The CFR's suggestion that Intelligence be given priority "lest pursuit of evidence or individuals for prosecution cause major foreign policy problems or complicate ongoing Intelligence and diplomatic activities" does not justify subordinating Law Enforcement. In many foreign countries, American Law Enforcement agents and their local activities are eagerly welcomed by the foreign governments who are concerned with stopping their national crime problems. There may be more distrust of American Intelligence. Since the majority of Law Enforcement cases are overt and carried out with the coordination of foreign police, there is little danger of Law Enforcement causing a "major foreign policy problem." RECOMMENDATIONS
Recommendations for the new Transnational Threats Committee:
1.This study recommends that the Committee include the Secretary of Treasury when addressing such issues as illegal smuggling and financial crimes. The agencies under the Department of Treasury, in addition to those under the Department of Justice, are actively involved in the national effort against transnational crime. Global crimes that fall under the Treasury jurisdiction include: narcotics and other contraband smuggling (U.S. Customs Service); counterfeiting American money (U.S. Secret Service); money laundering and financial crimes (Financial Crimes Enforcement Network). One obstacle to implementing this recommendation is the argument that inviting the Secretary of Treasury would be unnecessary because the Attorney General is already representing Law Enforcement in the Committee. While the departments under the Attorney General are also involved in these areas, there are some situations where Department of Treasury would be more affected and more importantly, the Committee and its national strategy would benefit from the Treasury perspective. 2.The Committee should set up a practical, working hierarchy overseas to conduct Intelligence and Law Enforcement activities under a coordinated policy. One of the stated functions of the Committee is to "develop guidelines" for coordination overseas but it is necessary to specify that the Committee needs to set up guidelines for a specific hierarchy, if coordination reforms are to be effective. There is already interest in both communities in improving coordination of activities overseas. But in actual practice, Law Enforcement often acts independently of Intelligence and vice versa because lines of authority overseas can become blurred. Problems with communication are due there not being a single person or group to lead and organize the individual activities. It is further recommended that the Chief of Station (COS) be in charge of the actual coordination of these activities. As the head of the Embassy, the Ambassador should be kept informed of both Intelligence and Law Enforcement activities but his personal involvement in the details of coordination should continue to depend on the individual Ambassador. The Committee should give the Chief of Station clear guidelines for organizing activities and the authority necessary to accomplish efficient coordination of resources. They should clearly define the COS and the Law Enforcement responsibilities to each other as well as to the Ambassador. The major obstacle could be opposition from the Attorney General and Law Enforcement officials (especially FBI) who are supportive of greater cooperation but who are rapidly increasing their activities overseas and do not want to see their freedom limited by the Chief of Station. Another concern is that unless the Committee sets up clear lines of authority, it may be difficult for the Chief of Station to coordinate activities and ensure that Law Enforcement adheres to the guidelines. 3.The Committee should form a separate proactive strategy for Global Organized Crime and Drug Trafficking Networks. The IC, in order to avoid wasting resources through duplication, must recognize the similarities between Global Organized Crime and other transnational threats. However, the different activities and potential vulnerabilities of Global Organized Crime must also be acknowledged by the Committee if it is to form an effective strategy against the threat. For example, an intelligence strategy for Global Organized Crime might focus on gathering information on the international money laundering networks. Since laundered money is necessary to continue the daily operations of these criminal networks, a concentrated multi- agency attack on the money laundering channels could be debilitating to Global Organized Crime groups and Drug Traffickers. While terrorist groups can also be involved in money laundering, this strategy may not be as successful in preventing terrorist attacks. From the other perspective, strategies used against terrorism may not prove to be as effective against organized crime. Implementing this recommendation would strengthen the national effort against Global Organized Crime by producing a coordinated strategy specific to its own concerns. The costs would be low because it would not necessarily entail devoting more resources to addressing the threat but rather using the existing resources more effectively. Certain Committee members may oppose the recommendation on the belief that it would be a waste of resources to devote the Committee and the agencies they represent to one transnational threat when they could take advantage of the similarities of the threats. However, the importance of having a "Transnational Threat" committee instead of having a "Global Organized Crime" committee already takes advantage of these similarities by pooling the leaders and resources involved in all of these threats. Within the Committee, the differences should also be recognized. 4.The Committee should create more liaison programs between Intelligence and Law Enforcement dealing with Global Organized Crime. The two communities are already participating in programs like this, but since the benefits are significant, the Committee should encourage cooperation and integration on a working level through more programs. On a case by case level, they would benefit from the different perspectives and on a higher level of authority, they would benefit from the joint programs because it would help to facilitate future cooperation. The cost of adding more joint projects is relatively small when compared with the benefits of cases that result in greater intelligence gathering/prosecutions and in less resources being used overall because manpower and technology have been shared between the communities. 5.This study recommends that the Committee make efforts to improve coordination with foreign governments. Global cooperation is necessary to fight criminal groups with increasingly interconnected networks around the world. FBI Director Freeh has been very successful in establishing working partnerships with foreign Law Enforcement and governments. He sees building "cop-to-cop" connections as the key to fighting global crime. Just as strengthening the coordination between domestic agencies is a necessary step toward a more effective national strategy, improving coordination between American and foreign agencies is also an important part of reducing Global Organized Crime One obstacle would be the reluctance of Intelligence to work even closer with foreign governments, their intelligence agencies and their Law Enforcement. In the case of Russia, many law enforcement officials accept bribes from organized crime and detectives are sometimes forced to not report to their superiors for fear that the suspects will be warned of raids and arrests. Intelligence may not want to work too closely with foreign intelligence agencies in order to protect their sources and methods. However, there is always an intelligence problem of trust when dealing with human sources but the successes of HUMINT demonstrate that the benefits are worth the risks. 6.This study concurs with the HUMINT and Non-proliferation conference studies' recommendation for further use of HUMINT in dealing with transnational threats. These underground networks can be penetrated by human sources. Human agents can learn the complexities and vulnerabilities of an international network of criminal individuals and groups. The expensive satellite imagery that was helpful in collecting information on large military sites during the Cold War may not be that effective in collecting information on Global Organized Crime. There are more risks involved in trusting human sources but it is more effective in dealing with Global Organized Crime and the costs are low when compared with technical collection. Recommendations for the President: 7.This study recommends that the President confer regularly with the Transnational Threats Committee while forming his national strategy on Global Organized Crime. The new Committee offers the President an incredible opportunity to combine all of the separate abilities and interests represented by the DCI, the Attorney General, the Secretaries of State and Defense, under a unified set of anti-global crime objectives. Since IAA97 also states that the President may designate additional members, he has even more opportunities to use the Committee to respond to his needs with regard to transnational threats. The major obstacle is the President's own disapproval of the creation of the Committee. In his statement on signing the Authorization Act regarding the new Committee, he wrote, "Such efforts to dictate the President's policy process unduly intrude upon Executive prerogatives and responsibilities. I would note that under my Executive authority, I have already asked the NSC to examine these issues." The combined decisions of Intelligence and Law Enforcement leaders should provide insights into creating a coordinated policy that the NSC had previously not provided. The President frequently speaks about the importance of addressing transnational threats so he should be more interested in forming an effective solution-oriented policy against them. 8.The President should support the continuation of both the Attorney General and the Secretary of Treasury acting as representatives of Law Enforcement. The President should not select the Attorney General as the single representative for Law Enforcement. The Attorney General already acts as the Law Enforcement spokesperson in many areas dealing with Global Organized Crime. In areas that pertain more to the Treasury, such as financial crimes, the Secretary should continue to be brought in as a representative. MEASURING SUCCESS OF THE REFORMED INTELLIGENCE RESPONSE TO GLOBAL ORGANIZED CRIME
9.The Transnational Threats Committee should make formal annual assessments on the effects of the changes made through the reforms described above and address the weaknesses in the implementation. Reform and improvement of coordination should be a continuous process and the Committee needs to form a systematic way to continue reform of Intelligence and Law Enforcement coordination and the national response to Global Organized Crime. Possible areas for them to examine would be if there was a more cohesive national strategy; if activities overseas were actually being coordinated under the Chief of Station or if Law Enforcement officials were acting independently; and if, as a result of the reforms, there were improvements made in the Global Organized Crime assessments given to policy-makers. The President and his staff should also make a yearly assessment of the success of the Committee. He should provide feedback on how the Committee could better respond to transnational threats and provide him with information relevant to formulating a national strategy. Actual trends in Global Organized Crime and individual cases of major crime groups should be analyzed to determine if the coordinated response formulated by the Committee had an impact on the threat.

ARCPR: CRITICAL REFLECTIONS ON INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZED CRIME, MONEY LAUNDERING, AND CORRUPTION The Canadian Review of Policing Research (2004) ISSN: 1710 6915 CRITICAL REFLECTIONS ON INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZED CRIME, MONEY LAUNDERING, AND CORRUPTION Margaret. E. Beare
Margaret Beare
is an associate professor in the Sociology Department of York University and the Director of the Nathanson Centre for the Study of Organized Crime and Corruption at Osgoode Hall Law School, York University. What follows is a summary of a recently published book entitled Critical Reflections on Transnational Organized Crime, Money Laundering, and Corruption, published in 2003 by the University of Toronto Press, Toronto, Canada. Dr. Beare’s e-mail address is mbeare@yorku.ca. This book features the work of eleven international scholars who were asked to examine the policing and politics that surround transnational crime, organized crime, money laundering and corruption. Most countries are under pressure to respond to such criminal challenges in a uniform manner in accordance with numerous international agreements, conventions, and guidelines; but some critics are concerned about what might be described as a gradual “Americanization” of international policing practices and policies 1
. They are especially concerned about the high priority placed on proceeds of crime and money laundering. This book emphasizes the significance of transnational crimes or organized criminal activity, the impact of illegal proceeds of crime upon specific markets, and the diverse forms of corruption they create. The various articles challenge some of the current political preoccupations with these issues and attempt to compare rhetoric with more empirically-based realities. Themes and Structure of the Book The book explores a number of common themes: the exploitable nature of taking organized crime as problem; the non-empirical basis for much of the media, police, and political responses; and the unintended consequences that can result from well-intentioned enforcement initiatives. Of additional interest are the policing and security industries that have grown up to “combat” organized crime and corruption, and whose livelihoods benefit from the high priority assigned to these forms of criminality. Contributing Authors Chapter One
on “Transnational Organized Crime: The Strange Career of an American Concept” is written by Michael Woodiwiss. 2
He provides us with a historical mapping of the American roots of our current understanding of what has become known as organized crime, and traces not only the antiquity of concern over organized crime but the distortion of our current focus. Power and politics have a determining influence on the definitions of ‘organized crime’ in the present international community. Chapter Two
by Tom Naylor, 3
is entitled “Predators, Parasites, or Free-market Pioneers: Reflections on the Nature and Analysis of Profit-Driven Crime”. It asks the reader to re-examine at a more micro-level the claims that are typically made about profit-driven crimes. He establishes three classifications of profit-driven crimes: predatory crimes for profit, which involve involuntary transfers; market-based exchanges in which illegal goods or services are sold for profit; and commercial exchanges which are the illegal production or illegal distribution of otherwise legal goods or services. Each of these categories of profit-driven crime has a different impact on society, and that impact is not always negative. Hence, societal responses, particularly those of law enforcement agencies, might be wise to differentiate rather than to group together all profit-driven criminal activity under the heading of “organized crime”. Chapter Three,
“From National to Global, from Empirical to Legal: The Ambivalent Concept of Transnational Organized Crime”, is written by Valsimas Mitsilegas. 4
His chapter provides the current European interpretation of legislation in Italy, Germany, the United Kingdom, the European Union and the United Nations. He documents the vague, ill-defined national and organizational responses. His analysis outlines the emergence of the organized-crime offence at the global level, and examines anti-organized crime initiatives against a backdrop of fundamental legal principles, thereby revealing the negotiations and compromises that go into obtaining multi-jurisdictional agreements. Chapter Four, “The Business of Bribery: Globalization, Economic Liberalization, and the ‘Problem’ of Corruption”, is written by James Williams 5
and Margaret Beare, 6
and takes on the issue of transparency. The chapter examines the role of the World Bank, International Monetary Fund and other international organizations such as Transparency International in packaging the current focus on one specific form of corruption, namely that which hinders the economies of the more developed countries. The chapter traces the growing response of international communities to corruption, and argues that globalization has created new political and economic spaces that are being largely filled by initiatives that conform to an economic logic defined by the developed world. International organizations that appear to have separate voices are all reading from the same script: a script that supports global business and finance. Chapter Five
is entitled “Against Transnational Organized Crime, and is written by James Sheptycki. 7
It examines the language that has grown around the activities subsumed under “transnational organized crime”. Sheptycki describes the veil being drawn over police work as policing becomes increasingly international and takes on a new rhetoric of transnational organized crime. The police apparatus now includes security forces and elite squads operating according to diverse international standards. In this new order, traditional accountability mechanisms are no longer adequate. The hard-won advances towards visibility in domestic policing are undermined by the call for all-out war against transnational organized crime. Chapter Six
by Kyle Grayson 8
on “Discourse, Identity, and the US ‘War on Drugs’”, analyses from a Foucaultian perspective the foreign policies of the United States against drug trafficking. He examines the rhetoric of both the “war on drugs” and the “security-threat” that has succeeded in merging drugs with the traditional discourses of transnational crime. His objective in this chapter is to understand both the reasons why the United States has chosen to link drugs with security and the methods by which this linkage has been made. Chapter Seven
on ‘Global Markets and Crime”, is written by Vincenzo Ruggiero. 9
It presents case materials that illustrate the role of ‘legitimate’ professionals in facilitating many ‘transnational’ crimes. He argues that white-collar crime and organized crime are increasingly blurred within the international cross-jurisdictional criminal environment. Vincenzo Ruggiero emphasizes the close links between legitimate business and illegitimate operations and argues that forms of social control help to determine the forms that crime will take. He sees “globalization” changing social control mechanisms, in turn causing changes in criminal activity. One result is an increasingly blurred relationship between the concepts of white-collar crime and organized crime. Cases are presented that illustrate the role of corporations and other ‘legitimate’ segments of society in supporting or facilitating criminal activity. After these somewhat theoretical papers, the remaining four chapters examine more concrete law enforcement issues. In Chapter eight, “Organized Corporate Criminality: Corporate Complicity in Tobacco Smuggling”, Margaret Beare examines in detail one example of a white-collar-organized crime. The tobacco industry has been shown to have operated in identical ways to more traditional notions of organized criminals: actively engaged in smuggling, fraud, money laundering and violence. The revelations concerning the tobacco corporations lead us to question why they have avoided being labelled criminal for so long. While some of their immunity relates to the general difficulty with proving white-collar crime, other equally valid reasons relate to the power of the corporations, and the limited range of people to whom we apply the term “organized criminal” or, for that, matter apply the criminal law. Chapter Nine, “The War on Drugs and the Military: The Case of Colombia”, by Juan Gabriel Ronderos, 10
challenges the rhetoric of the “war” on drugs, and law-enforcement responses arising from the foreign policies that underlie the rhetoric. He examines the consequences of such policies and law enforcement on a country such as Colombia, and shows the unintended consequences of misdirected enforcement strategies or misguided priorities. Chapter Ten
is entitled “Drug Trafficking and Organized Crime in Canada: A Study of High-level Drug Networks” ad is written by Fred Desroches. 11
He demonstrates empirically that the popular rhetoric about so-called “high-level drug traffickers” is largely false. His study 12
is part of a growing body of empirical research suggesting that even high-level drug traffickers come in many different types and that the members of a network engage in many different working arrangements among its members. The key finding is that the majority of traffickers are individual entrepreneurs who could quit, aspire to move up in the illicit occupational chain, or change and work with the competition. His study, based on interviews with high-level drug traffickers in prisons across Canada, dispels some of the myths about these criminals and their relationship to the larger entity collectively termed “organized crime”. If these criminals are not as imagined, perhaps other unverified assumptions about organized criminal groups should be questioned. Chapter Eleven
brings the book to an end with “Follow-the-Money Methods in Crime Control Policy”, a second chapter by Tom Naylor. It was written specifically for the Nathanson Centre for the Study of Organized Crime and Corruption on discusses the inherent fallacies of enforcement strategies directed against money laundering and proceeds of crime. Naylor examines forfeiture laws and the prime international policing strategy of going after illicit money. He challenges the assumptions upon which the prioritizing of anti-money laundering initiatives is based and suggests alternative approaches.

CHINESE TRANSNATIONAL ORGANIZED CRIME: THE FUK CHING
by James O. Finckenauer, Ph.D. International Center National Institute of Justice Organizational Structure
The organizational structure of Chinese organized crime in the United States is quite complex. Broadly defined, there is a great variety of Chinese criminal organizations. These include gangs, secret societies, triads, tongs, Taiwanese organized crime groups, and strictly US-based tongs and gangs. According to Ko-lin Chin, the foremost academic expert in the U.S. on Chinese organized crime, there is no empirical support for the belief that there is a well-organized, monolithic, hierarchical criminal cartel called the ?Chinese Mafia.? Chin says: ?My findings...do not support the notion that a chain of command exists among these various crime groups or that they coordinate with one another routinely in international crimes such as heroin trafficking, money laundering, and the smuggling of aliens? (1996:123). In order to simplify and focus our discussion, this analysis will concentrate on the Fuk Ching gang. The Fuk Ching are active in New York City, and are regarded as one of the most powerful, and also transnationally active, Chinese organized crime groups in the U.S. (Chin, 1996). They are estimated to have approximately 35 members, with another 20 members currently in prison. Other major gangs in New York City include the Ghost Shadows, Flying Dragons, Tung On, and Born-to-Kill. The New York City gangs, like the Fuk Ching, mainly operate extortion and protection rackets in defined neighborhoods in New York?s Chinatown. Their victims are mostly businesses in Chinatown. In California, the Chinese organized crime presence and problem is quite different from that in New York. In California, the dominant groups are the Wo Hop To and the the Wah Ching. One of the structural characteristics that makes Chinese organized crime different from other forms is the relationship between some of the street gangs and certain adult organizations. The latter are called tongs. The Fuk Ching, for example, are affiliated with the Fukien American Association. The Fukien American Association ? as with other tongs and their relationships with gangs ? provide the Fuk Ching with a physical place to gather and hang out. They allow the gang to operate on their (the tong?s) territory, thus legitimizing them with the community. They also provide criminal opportunities (such as protecting gambling operations), as well as supplying money and guns. The Fuk Ching originally emerged in New York in the mid-1980s, and as with other gangs, their main criminal activity in Chinatown was extortion. They were founded by a collection of young men (youth in their late teens and early twenties) from Fujian province in China -- many if not all of whom had criminal records in China. Fuk Ching recruitment today continues to be among Fujianese teenagers. Tong-affiliated gangs, like the Fuk Ching, have an ah kung (grandfather) or shuk foo (uncle) who is their tong leader. The top gang position is the dai dai lo (big big brother). Communicationbetween the tong and the gang occurs principally between these two individuals. Below the dai dai lo in descending order are the dai lo(s) or big brothers, the yee lo/saam lo (clique leaders), and at the bottom the ma jai or little horses. There are a variety of norms and rules that govern the gangs. These include respecting the ah kung, beating up members of other gangs on your turf, not using drugs, following the orders of the dai lo, and not betraying the gang. Rules violators are punished, sometimes severely, such as through physical assault and killing. Violence
Our research and our interviews with various experts confirms that violence is a defining characteristic of Chinese criminal gangs. Use of violence within the group and against other organized crime groups is very prevalent. Disputes over territory and criminal markets among the gangs are typically resolved using kong so, a process of peaceful negotiation. When this does not occur, however, the resolution is usually a violent one, in which guns are used against rival gang members. Law enforcement authorities believe that an escalation of gang violence has taken place in recent years, due in part to the advent of the Fuk Ching, and to gang involvement in alien smuggling activities. Based on his research, Chin concludes the following with respect to Chinese gang violence in general: The capacity for violence appears to be one of the key defining characteristics of street gang culture. Its employment, however, is shaped and determined by a cluster of constraints related to profit-generating goals. Violence between and among gangs is regulated through an agent or ah kung who attempts to channel aggressive behavior in ways that effectively maintain gang coherence. Gang coherence in turn supports the gang?s involvement in extortion activities and in the provision of protection services to organized vice industries in the community (Chin, 1996:138). The Fuk Ching are violent, but their use of violence is not very sophisticated nor specialized. It is not the systematic use of violence (including threats) to protect and gain monopoly control of criminal markets that is associated with mature forms of organized crime. Instead it is more likely to be random street level violence, with guns, employed by anyone in the gang. Sometimes this violence is sanctioned and sometimes not. Economic Resources
Understanding alien smuggling to be the illegal movement of migrants across national borders, and human trafficking to be migrant smuggling that includes coercion and exploitation, the Fuk Ching are extensively involved in both types of activities. Indeed, these criminal activities, along with kidnapping, are the main transnational crimes of the Fuk Ching. Their dominance is related to Fujian Province being the principal source of Chinese being smuggled and trafficked into North America. On the domestic scene, their main criminal activities in New York City?s Chinatown are extortion and gambling. Each Chinese gang dominates these crimes in theirparticular Chinatown neighborhoods. This includes the Fuk Ching. The professionalism and sophistication of the Fuk Ching are quite low, again as compared to more mature forms of organized crime. The same is true of other Chinese criminal gangs operating in the United States. This may be due to their being generally much younger than, for example, LCN or Russian organized crime figures. Also, their criminal activities are not particularly sophisticated, although the Fuk Ching may be becoming more complex in their organizational structure as they become more heavily engaged in human trafficking. In his research, Chin (1996) found that Chinese gangs were quite active in legitimate businesses in New York City?s Chinatown. For example, they owned or operated restaurants, retail stores, vegetable stands, car services, ice cream parlors, fish markets, and video stores. On a higher, more professional level, they also owned or operated wholesale supply firms, factories, banks, and employment agencies. In addition, on the West Coast Chinese gangs are believed to have penetrated the entertainment industry. Perhaps it is because of their relatively small size, the youth of their members, their lack of business experience and acumen, and the geographical constraints in which they operate, that Chinese gangs such as the Fuk Ching do not seem to play significant roles in the broader legitimate economy. Political Resources
The expert consensus is that the Fuk Ching, like other Chinese gangs, do not have the connections and stature to make them capable of corrupting U.S. police and judges. There have been only one or two cases of police corruption (none in recent years), and no cases of judicial corruption. As to political influence, there is some ability to manipulate the political system via corruption in China ? namely in Fujian Province and with respect to their human trafficking enterprise. In the United States, however, there is no evidence of corrupting the political process, of getting members elected or appointed to political office, nor of being able to manage media coverage of their activities. They are influential only in Chinatown, and their connections to U.S. politicians are non-existent. Any political influence Chinese gangs have is exerted through the tongs with which they are affiliated. For example, it is reported that the head of the Fukien American Association once gave $6,500 to a New York City Mayor?s re-election campaign (Kleinknecht, 1996:168). That the affiliation is not only beneficial to the gangs is evidenced in Chin?s report that tongs and other Chinatown community organizations benefit from the Chinese gangs? threats of extortion because business owners donate money to the associations in the belief that this will buy protection (1996). There is no evidence that Chinese gangs are involved with political terrorism either abroad or at home. Nor that they are associated with armed political groups of any kind. Response of Law Enforcement
The New York City Police Department (NYPD), which polices the neighborhood in which the Fuk Ching are active, uses all the standard law enforcement practices commonly used to combat organized crime. These include informants, undercover investigators, and electronic surveillance. In addition, both the police and the FBI support and encourage extortion victims to use hot lines to report their victimization. The NYPD has also created an Asian Gang Intelligence Unit that employs street patrols to monitor street gangs. Of the 15 Chinese crime groups indicted under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) between 1985 and 1994, one involved the Fuk Ching. In that 1993 case, 20 defendants were charged with, and pled guilty to murder. The investigation was conducted jointly by the FBI and the NYPD. On the international level, U.S. law enforcement has undertaken a number of initiatives to improve international cooperation against Chinese organized crime groups. These include the creation of the International Law Enforcement Academy (ILEA) in Bangkok, Thailand, and sponsorship of numerous international meetings on Asian organized crime. Annual meetings of the International Asian Organized Crime Conference attract more than a thousand law enforcement officials from dozens of countries. Both the ILEA and the conferences promote interaction among officials of affected countries, and lead to better cooperation and better information. Ko-lin Chin concludes that many crimes in Chinese-American communities ? especially drug trafficking, money laundering, and human trafficking ? are linked to China. He says that Chinese gang members flee to China when sought by American law enforcement. He recommends that ?deportation, extradition, joint operations, and intelligence sharing among law enforcement authorities from various countries...be carried out routinely....extradition treaties...be instated....[and that] U.S. authorities...be more culturally sensitive in dealing with foreign law enforcement agencies? (Chin, 1996:187). The External Environment
There is not general cultural acceptance of Chinese gangs such as the Fuk Ching in Chinatown. Most Chinese business owners comply with gang extortion demands because compliance is easier and less risky than resistance. As previously indicated, the gang affiliation with a tong gives them a degree of acceptability in the neighborhoods associated with that particular tong. The gang must be tolerated in order to gain any benefit that accrues from the tong. It would seem that there is little need in Chinatown for awareness raising campaigns on organized crime, or for sensitizing citizens on the dangers and threats posed by Chinese gangs. The Chinese who live in these neighborhoods are fully aware and fully sensitized. Rather than public information campaigns, Chinese businessmen would prefer a tougher criminal justice system. As Chin reports, ?they [Chinese businessmen] would like to see harsher punishment for offenders, the reinstitution of the death penalty..., and the deportation of chronic Chinese criminals? (1996:98). They also want to see many more Chinese police officers in theirneighborhoods. Because of the compartmentalized nature of Chinese organized crime in the United States, the public at large is little aware of and little concerned about what is going on in Chinatowns in U.S. cities. National media pay relatively little attention to these problems. For example, an Internet search of major U.S. newspapers under the topic ?Asian organized crime? for the period January 1, 1998 - August 1, 2000 produced only 13 articles. Chinese involvement in human smuggling, however, may be the exception to this rule. Chinese human smuggling has received considerable attention. A recent conference in Washington, DC on human smuggling pointed to five possible reasons for the high public profile given Chinese smuggling operations: (1) they are expensive; (2) associated human rights abuses are considerable; (3) they are highly efficient; (4) there is an enormous potential pool of migrants; and (5) collecting intelligence and other information from China is extraordinarily difficult (Conference Report, Transatlantic Workshop on Human Smuggling, 2000). Human trafficking activities by Chinese gangs such as the Fuk Ching are contributing to this higher profile. REFERENCES

The
Hubble
Space
Telescope
turned 15,
with
750,000 photographs of deep space
and Earth to its credit, but its future is now uncertain. Hubble
was launched by the
Space
Shuttle Discovery on April 25, 1990, and opened a new era in astronomy. However, the
telescope, a cooperative effort of NASA and the
European Space
Agency, would not be operational until three years later. [The Hubble Space Telescope]

A mirror that had been improperly ground was corrected in 1993, when a new camera was also installed in the
first repair mission by a space
shuttle. Once repaired, the
telescope
beamed back photographs 10 times sharper than ever before of galaxies, supernovas, giant explosions marking the
death of a star and the
birth of a black hole. Thanks to Hubble, flying above the
atmospheric distortion that hinders even more powerful Earth-based telescopes, scientists have been able to confirm that the
universe is rapidly expanding and to calculate precisely its age, at 13.7 billion years, according to NASA. Among other achievements, Hubble's observations allowed scientists to confirm the
existence of a strange form of energy called dark energy; proved the
existence of super-massive black holes; provided sharp views of a comet hitting Jupiter; and showed that the
process of forming planetary systems is common throughout the
galaxy, NASA said in a statement. NASA has so far decided not to send a shuttle to repair the
aging Hubble, citing the
450 million dollars it would cost to do so. But the
space
agency's new chief, Michael Griffin, has said he would revisit the
decision. Astronauts have serviced Hubble
four times, and many scientists hoped that a fifth service mission would be funded to enable Hubble
to function to 2011, when its infrared replacement, the
James Webb Space
Telescope, is scheduled to arrive. Currently, it is believed that Hubble's aging solar cells will provide enough energy to survive to 2007.   Hubble Space Telescope turns 15, with a galaxy of achievements

White House Cuts Hubble Servicing Mission from 2006 Budget Request Astronomers Surprised by White House Plan to Scuttle Hubble The Fight Begins Once Again for Hubble's Life By Leonard David
Senior Space Writer posted: 24 January 2005 06:44 am ET
space
A White House decision to cut funding for a Hubble Space Telescope servicing mission and dump the observatory into a remote stretch of ocean waters at a future date is sure to incite debate in scientific, engineering, and policy making circles. Intensive work has been underway at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center to develop telerobotic servicing skills for the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) in the event that a space shuttle crew is never again sent to the orbiting facility. Aerospace firms in the United States and in Canada have teamed with NASA to develop a Hubble Robotic Vehicle Deorbit Module. Either a robotic or shuttle-based servicing option reportedly would cost in excess of $1 billion. That pricetag is viewed by the White House, according to sources, as not affordable given other high-priority and more expensive efforts, such as the return-to-flight of the space shuttle program, as well as moving forward on NASA’s Moon, Mars and beyond agenda. White House plans to scuttle Hubble is part of NASA’s 2006 budget request, sources said, with some money in the budget allocated to using a propulsion module coupled to Hubble for its safe but destructive deorbiting. The cutting of the HST servicing mission from NASA’s 2006 budget request was first reported
by Space News
on its website Friday and on  SPACE.com
. Leading the fight Senator Barbara Mikulski (D-Md.), a fervent Hubble supporter whose state is home to both the Goddard Space Flight Center and the Space Telescope Science Institute, issued a statement late January 21 in which she vowed to continue advocating an HST servicing mission. "It is essential that we have a safe and reliable servicing mission to Hubble," Mikulski said, that is consistent with the findings of the Columbia Accident Investigation Board and last month’s findings of a National Academy of Sciences (NAS) panel on the Hubble issue. On December 8, in the NAS final report released by the Committee on the Assessment of Options for Extending the Life of the Hubble Space Telescope, a blue ribbon group of experts said that NASA should reinstate a space shuttle mission to refurbish the Earth-orbiting telescope. "I led the fight to add $300 million to NASA’s budget last year for a Hubble servicing mission, and I plan to lead the fight again this year. This is what the American people expect and deserve," Mikulski said in a statement.  In defense of Hubble Response to the White House decision has engendered a wait-and-see attitude in some astronomical quarters, while others have been quick to react. Hubble’s best days lie ahead, predicted John Bahcall, a professor of natural sciences at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey. In 1998, he was a recipient of the National Medal of Science for his pioneering efforts in neutrino astrophysics and his contributions to the development and planning of the Hubble Space Telescope. "President Nixon cancelled in 1973 the Hubble Telescope while it was still in the development phase. The reason was similar: other activities in the NASA budget took priority," Bahcall told SPACE.com. "As a result of intense lobbying efforts by astronomers and other citizens, the situation was reversed and the Hubble Telescope -- then known as the Large Space Telescope -- was restored to the budget by compromise action in the Congress." Bahcall said that Hubble has contributed enormously to scientific knowledge and to America’s respect abroad. The telescope represents achievements of which all Americans can be proud, he said. "I am confident that Americans of all walks of life will come to the defense of the Hubble and cause the Congress to restore the repair of the telescope to the NASA budget," Bahcall said. Telerobotic progress Excellent progress is being made on a telerobotic approach to servicing the Hubble, said Jim Crocker, vice president of civil space at Lockheed Martin Space Systems of Denver. The firm has supported NASA’s planning and then repair and servicing of the HST via four space shuttle missions to date. The telerobotics team at work at Goddard Space Flight Center "have a good shot at pulling this off," Crocker told SPACE.com
the day before the Space News
story on the White House HST decision appeared. Lockheed Martin’s role in the rocket-launched Hubble Robotic Vehicle Deorbit Module (HRVDM), Crocker said, is providing all the sensors to do the rendezvous and docking with the Hubble, as well as provide the liquid-fueled propellant module that would later deorbit the telescope. For their part, Canada’s MacDonald, Dettwiler and Associates (MDA) Ltd. -- through its MD Robotics group in Brampton, Ontario -- is providing the Dextre robot that’s part of the HRVDM. It is being specially configured to replace batteries, gyroscopes, and perhaps an instrument on the HST to extend its life. NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center is overseeing and integrating the HRVDM work. Crocker said that simulations performed at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight center have converted doubters, including him, that performing many of the scheduled Hubble servicing tasks through the tender loving care of telerobotics is feasible. "That’s not to say it’s not challenging," Crocker said, "but the team is making a convincing story." Rabbit out of the hat There’s also good news to report in keeping Hubble in an operating mode. Worry centers on HST’s gyroscopes, batteries, or other gear that might fail early, negating the observatory’s useful lifetime. "The team continues to pull rabbits out of the hat," Crocker said. For instance, a two gyro science mode, along with the needed software has been worked out. HST’s original design had to have three gyros working to do science. Additionally, a new battery management approach is being adopted. "That’s good news," Crocker said. "I’m hearing we’re likely to be able to get [HST] into 2008 now." At the end of the day, Crocker concluded, whatever option is decided upon for Hubble servicing and its ultimate reentry, "everyone on the team wants the best chance of success possible."    Sponsored Links

TREC-8 Interactive Track Guidelines
TREC-8 Interactive Track Guidelines Goal  ----  The high-level goal of the Interactive Track in TREC-8 remains the investigation of searching as an interactive task by examining the process as well as the outcome. To this end a experimental framework has been designed with the following common features:         - an interactive search task         - 6 topics         - a document collection to be searched         - a required set of searcher (demographics) questionnaires         - 6 classes of data to be collected at each site and submitted to NIST         - 3 summary measures to be calculated by NIST for use by participants The framework will allow groups to estimate the effect of their experimental manipulation free and clear of the main (additive) effects of participant and topic and it will reduce the effect of interactions. In TREC-8 the emphasis will be on each group's exploration of different approaches to supporting the common searcher task and understanding the reasons for the results they get. No formal coordination of hypotheses or comparison of systems across sites is planned for TREC-8, but groups are encouraged to seek out and exploit synergies. As a first step, groups are strongly encouraged to make the focus of their planned investigations known to other track participants as soon as possible, preferably via the track listserv at trec-int@ohsu.edu.  Contact track chair Bill Hersh
to join. General Description  -------------------  A minimum of 12 participating searchers, one experimental system, and one control system per site will be required.  The control system can be any IR system appropriate to the goals of the local experiment, e.g. a variant of the local experimental system, some other baseline system such as SMART, ZPRISE, etc.  (See "2. Augmentation" in the detailed experimental design for information about how to use more than eight searchers or more than one experimental system within this design.) Each searcher will perform six searches on the Financial Times of London 1991-1994 collection (part of the TREC-8 adhoc collection), using six topics especially chosen from the TREC-8 adhoc topics and modified for use in the interactive track.  Each searcher will perform half of the total number of searches on the site's experimental system and the other half on its control system.  The experimental design (see below) determines the order in which each searcher performs the query and uses the systems (experimental and control). In resolving experimental design questions not covered here (e.g., scheduling of tutorials and searches, etc.), participating sites should try to minimize the differences between the conditions under which a given searcher uses the control and those under which s/he uses the experimental system. For example, running all the control searches for a participant on one day and the searches on the experimental system on another invites unequal, confounding conditions. Topics ------ Each of the topics will describe a need for information of a particular type. Contained within the documents of the collection to be searched will be multiple distinct examples or instances of the needed information. The interactive topics will be modified versions of specially selected adhoc topics. Here is an example TREC-6 adhoc topic:         Number: 303          Title: Hubble Telescope Achievements          Description:          Identify positive accomplishments of the Hubble telescope          since it was launched in 1991.         Narrative:          Documents are relevant that show the Hubble telescope has          produced new data, better quality data than previously          available, data that has increased human knowledge of the          universe, or data that has led to disproving previously          existing theories or hypotheses.  Documents limited to the          shortcomings of the telescope would be irrelevant.  Details          of repairs or modifications to the telescope without          reference to positive achievements would not be relevant. Here is an example of the same topic as it would be modified for use in the TREC-8 interactive track. Note the addition of the "Please save" paragraph and the removal of the usual Narrative section with its specific criteria for relevance or non-relevance:         Number: 303i          Title: Hubble Telescope Achievements          Description:          Identify positive accomplishments of the Hubble telescope          since it was launched in 1991.         Instances:         In the time alloted, please find as many DIFFERENT positive          accomplishments of the sort described above as you can.         Please save at least one document for EACH such DIFFERENT          accomplishment.         If one document discusses several such accomplishments, then          you need not save other documents that repeat those, since your          goal is to identify as many DIFFERENT accomplishments of the sort          described above as possible. Here are the topics for TREC-8 in NUMERICAL order. See the section "Experimental design for a site" below for their assignment to blocks and the order of presentation within the experimental design. Number: 408i Title: tropical storms Description: What tropical storms (hurricanes and typhoons) have caused property damage and/or loss of life? Instances: In the time alloted, please find as many DIFFERENT storms of the sort described above as you can. Please save at least one document for EACH such DIFFERENT storm. If one document discusses several such storms, then you need not save other documents that repeat those, since your goal is to identify as many DIFFERENT storms of the sort described above as possible. Number: 414i Title: Cuba, sugar, imports Description: What countries import Cuban sugar? Instances: In the time alloted, please find as many DIFFERENT countries of the sort described above as you can. Please save at least one document for EACH such DIFFERENT country. If one document discusses several such countries, then you need not save other documents that repeat those, since your goal is to identify as many DIFFERENT countries of the sort described above as possible. Number: 428i Title: declining birth rates Description: What countries other than the US and China have or have had a declining birth rate? Instances: In the time alloted, please find as many DIFFERENT countries of the sort described above as you can. Please save at least one document for EACH such DIFFERENT country. If one document discusses several such countries, then you need not save other documents that repeat those, since your goal is to identify as many DIFFERENT countries of the sort described above as possible. Number: 431i Title: robotic technology Description: What are the latest developments in robotic technology and in its use? Instances: In the time alloted, please find as many DIFFERENT developments of the sort described above as you can. Please save at least one document for EACH such DIFFERENT development. If one document discusses several such developments, then you need not save other documents that repeat those, since your goal is to identify as many DIFFERENT developments of the sort described above as possible. Number: 438i Title: tourism, increase Description: What countries have experienced an increase in tourism? Instances: In the time alloted, please find as many DIFFERENT countries of the sort described above as you can. Please save at least one document for EACH such DIFFERENT country. If one document discusses several such countries, then you need not save other documents that repeat those, since your goal is to identify as many DIFFERENT countries of the sort described above as possible. Number: 446i Title: tourists, violence Description: In what countries have tourists been subject to acts of violence causing bodily harm or death? Instances: In the time alloted, please find as many DIFFERENT countries of the sort described above as you can. Please save at least one document for EACH such DIFFERENT country. If one document discusses several such countries, then you need not save other documents that repeat those, since your goal is to identify as many DIFFERENT countries of the sort described above as possible. Searcher task ------------- The task of the interactive searcher is to save documents, which, taken together, contain as many different instances as possible of  the type of information the topic expresses a need for - within a 20 minute time limit. Searchers will be encouraged to avoid saving documents which contribute no instances beyond those in documents already saved, but there will be no scoring penalty for saving such documents and searchers will be told that. Instructions to be given to searchers ------------------------------------- The following introductory instructions are to be given once to each searcher before the first search:         "Imagine that you have just returned from a visit to your doctor          during which it was discovered that you are suffering from high         blood pressure. The doctor suggests that you take a new experimental         drug, but you wonder what alternative treatments are currently          available.  You decide to investigate the literature on your own         to satisfy your need for information about what different          alternatives are available to you for high blood pressure treatment.         You really need only one document for each of the different          treatments for high blood pressure.          You find and save a single document that lists four treatment drugs.         Then you find and save another two documents that each discusses a         separate alternative treatment: one that discusses the use of         calcium and one that talks about regular exercise.  You've run out          of time and stop your search. In all, you have identified six          different instances of alternative treatments in three documents.          ---         In this experiment, you will face a similar task. You will be          presented with several descriptions of needed information on a          number of topics. In each case there can be multiple examples or          instances of the type of information that's needed.         We would like you to identify as many different instances as you         can of the needed information for each topic that will be presented          to you -  as many as you can in the 20 minutes you will be given          to search.  Please save one document for EACH DIFFERENT instance          of the needed information that you identify. If you save one          document that contains several instances, try not to save additional         documents that contain ONLY those instances. However, you will not          be penalized if you save documents unnecessarily.           As you identify an instance of the needed information, please keep          track of which instances you have found: write down a word or short          phrase to identify the instance, or--if the system provides a          facility to keep track of instances--use it.                  Carefully read each topic to understand the type of information          needed. This will vary from topic to topic. On one topic you may be          looking for instances of a certain kind of event. On another you may          be searching for examples of certain sorts of people, places, or          things.         Do you have any questions about          - what we mean by instances of needed information          - the way in which you are to save nonredundant documents for each           instance?" Searcher questionnaires (minimum) ----------------------- Provided by Rutgers (see track web site) Data to be collected and submitted to NIST (emailed to over@nist.gov) ------------------------------------------ Several sorts of result data will be collected for evaluation/analysis (for all searches unless otherwise specified):    ===>  Due at NIST by 30. August 1999:         1. sparse format data       ===>  Due at NIST by when the site reports for the conference are due:         2. rich format data         3. a full narrative description of one interactive session for            whichever topic is designated as T1         4. any further guidance or refinement of the task specification            given to the searchers         5. data from the common searcher questionnaires Sparse format data for each search will comprise the list of documents saved and the elapsed clock time of the search. The searcher's selection (choice) of items for the final output list must be identified in terms of each document's TREC document identifier (DOCNO). The elapsed (clock) time in seconds taken for the search, from the time the searcher first sees the topic until s/he declares the search to be finished, should be recorded.  It is assumed that the interactive search takes place in one uninterrupted session.  If a session is unavoidably interrupted, it is recommended that it be abandoned and the topic given to another searcher.  Sparse format data will be the basis for the summary evaluation at NIST, which will produce a triple for each search: instance precision, instance recall, and elapsed clock time. Rich format data for each search will record: - the word or phrase each searcher records to describe each   instance s/he identifies (no reference to the containing document(s)) - significant events in the course of the interaction and their    timing.             Rich format data are intended for analytical evaluation by the            experimenters.             All significant events and their timing in the course of the            interaction should be recorded.  The events listed below are those            that seem to be fairly generally applicable to different systems            and interactive environments; however, the list may need extending            or modifying for specific systems and so should be taken as a            suggestion rather than a requirement:           o Intermediate search formulations:  if appropriate to the              system, these should be recorded.           o Documents viewed:  "viewing" is taken to mean the searcher              seeing a title or some other brief information about a              document; these events should be recorded.           o Documents seen:  "seeing" is taken to mean the searcher              seeing the text of a document, or a substantial section of              text; these events should be recorded.            o Terms entered by the searcher:  if appropriate to the              system, these should be recorded.           o Terms seen (offered by the system):  if appropriate to the              system, these should be recorded.           o Selection/rejection:  documents or terms selected by the              user for any further stage of the search (in addition to the              final selection of documents).  Format of sparse data to be submitted to NIST --------------------------------------------- TWO files from each site            A. Search file         Here a "search" is the interaction of a searcher given a topic         and asked to carry out the interactive search task using a given          system against the collection - lasting at most 20 minutes.         One line for EACH SEARCH, each line containing the          following blank-delimited items from left to right:                 1. Unique site ID                 2. Search ID  - site's choice (links search & document files)                 3. Searcher ID - site's choice                 4. System ID - site's choice                 5. TREC topic number                                          6. Elapsed time - number of secs., fractions truncated                    Clock time from the moment the searcher sees the                     topic until the moment the searcher indicates the                     search is complete or time is up.   B. Documents file         One line for each document in a given search result,         each line containing the following blank-delimited         items from left to right:                 1. Chronological sequence number ( "1", "2") within a search                    Use number of last time saved if saved multiple times.                          2. Search ID (from search file)                 3. TREC document identifier (DOCNO)              NOTE: Reported data items listed within each line must NOT          contain whitespace.      Format of other data to be submitted to NIST -------------------------------------------- Data other than that in sparse-format should be submitted as ASCII text files. The FA-1 score plus the questionaire data for each searcher should be  submitted in a separate file with format close to the following example but with the real responses to the right of the colons. The Tutorial Worksheet and Experimenter Note need not be submitted.         S i t e:         S e a r c h e r  I D:         FA-1 score:  ?         P r e - s e a r c h :                   (1 per searcher)         Searcher:       id         Condition:      ?         Degrees:        degree major date         Degrees:        degree major date         Degrees:        degree major date         Degrees:        degree major date         Degrees:        degree major date         Occupation:     ...         Gender:         M | F         Age:            nn         Previous TREC:  Y | N         Online searching: nn         Q1:             1-5         Q2:             1-5         Q3:             1-5         Q4:             1-5         Q5:             1-5         Q6:             1-5         Q7:             1-5         Q8:             1-5         S e a r c h :                           (8 per searcher)         Searcher:       id         Condition:      ?         Topic #:        nnn         Q1:             1-5         Q2:             1-5         Q3:             1-5         Q4:             1-5         Q5:             1-5         Q6:             1-5         P o s t - s y s t e m :                 (2 per searcher)         Searcher:       id         Condition:      ?         Q1:             1-5         Q2:             1-5         Q3:             1-5         Comments:       ...         S e a r c h e r   w o r k s h e e t :   (8 per searcher)         Searcher:       id         Condition:      ?         Topic #:        nnn         1.              ...         2.              ...         3.              ...         .         .         .                  E x i t :                               (1 per searcher)         Searcher        id         Q1:             1-5         Q2:             1-5         Q3:             1-5         Q4:             one-system's-name       rank                         other-system's-name     rank         Q5:             one-system's-name       rank                         other-system's-name     rank         Q6:             one-system's-name       rank                         other-system's-name     rank         Q7:             ...         Q8:             ...         Q9:             ... Evaluation of data submitted to NIST ------------------------------------ Evaluation by NIST of the sparse format data will proceed as follows. For each topic, a pool will be formed containing the unique documents saved by at least one searcher for that topic regardless of site. For each topic, the NIST assessor, normally the topic author, will be asked  to:         - read the topic carefully          - read each of the documents from the pool for that topic and            gradually:            - create a list of instances of the topic's needed information              type found somewhere in the documents            - select and record a short phrase describing each instance found            - determine which documents contain which instances            - bracket each instance in the text of the document in which it               was found For each search (by a given participant for a given topic at a given site),  NIST will use the submitted list of selected documents and the assessor's instance-document mapping for the topic to calculate:         - the fraction of total instances (as determined by the assessor) for            the topic that are covered by the submitted documents (i.e.,            instance recall)         - the fraction of the submitted documents which contain one or more           instances (i.e., instance precision)   The third measure, elapsed clock time, will be taken directly from the  submitted results for each search. Experimental design for a site ------------------------------   1. Minimal experimental matrix as run     The design for this year's track departs from last year's.  One limitation     of last year's balanced block design was the potential statistical     confouding of topic and its order.  A design that controls for query order     leads to a simpler statistical analysis of results.     As such, this year's approach will insure that each query is searched in     each position (first through sixth) by each system.  This requires a     minimum of 12 searchers per site.  In addition, the query orders for     each site will need to be generated in a pseudorandom fashion.  To make     this process consistent, the query orders will be generated by the OHSU     group.  Below is an example of system-query order for a site.  (NOTE:     Please do not use this example, as new sets must be generated for each     12-searcher block.)                  Subject       Block #1           Block #2                      1      System 1: 6-1-2    System 2: 3-4-5                      2      System 2: 1-2-3    System 1: 4-5-6                      3      System 2: 2-3-4    System 1: 5-6-1                      4      System 2: 3-4-5    System 1: 6-1-2                      5      System 1: 4-5-6    System 2: 1-2-3                      6      System 1: 5-6-1    System 2: 2-3-4                      7      System 2: 6-1-2    System 1: 3-4-5                      8      System 1: 1-2-3    System 2: 4-5-6                      9      System 1: 2-3-4    System 2: 5-6-1                     10      System 1: 3-4-5    System 2: 6-1-2                     11      System 2: 4-5-6    System 1: 1-2-3                     12      System 2: 5-6-1    System 1: 2-3-4     Query blocks should be requested from Bill Hersh
as early as possible.   2. Augmentation      The design for a given site can be augmented in two ways:        1. Participants can be added in groups of 6 using the design           above.  Additional blocks should be requested from Bill           Hersh.        2. Systems can be added by adding additional groups of 6 users           with each new system.  Additional blocks should be requested           Bill Hersh.      Topics cannot be added/subtracted individually for each site.       All augmentations other than the two listed above, however interesting,       are outside the scope of this design. If sites plan such adjunct       experiments, they are encouraged to design them for maximal synergy       with the track design.  3. Analysis      Up to each group, but all are strongly encouraged to take advantage      of the experimental design and undertake:         1. exploratory data analysis            to examine the patterns of correlation, interaction, etc.            involving the major factors. Some example plots for the TREC-6            interactive data (recall or precision by searcher or topic)            are available on the Interactive Track web site            <> under "Interactive Track History".                     2. analysis of variance (ANOVA), where appropriate,            to estimate the separate contributions of searcher, topic and             system as a first step in understanding why the results of one             search are different from those of another Last updated: Wednesday, 20-Aug-03 07:33:34 Date created: Monday, 31-Jul-00 For information about this webpage contact Paul Over

TREC-7 Interactive Track Guidelines
TREC-7 Interactive Track Guidelines Goal ---- The high-level goal of the Interactive Track in TREC-7 remains the investigation of searching as an interactive task by examining the process as well as the outcome. To this end a experimental framework has been designed with the following common features: - an interactive search task - 8 topics - a document collection to be searched - a required set of searcher (demographics) questionnaires - a required psychometric test for all searchers - 6 classes of data to be collected at each site and submitted to NIST - 3 summary measures to be calculated by NIST for use by participants The framework will allow groups to estimate the effect of their experimental manipulation free and clear of the main (additive) effects of participant and topic and it will reduce the effect of interactions. In TREC-7 the emphasis will be on each group's exploration of different approaches to supporting the common searcher task and understanding the reasons for the results they get. No formal coordination of hypotheses or comparison of systems across sites is planned for TREC-7, but groups are encouraged to seek out and exploit synergies. As a first step, groups are strongly encouraged to make the focus of their planned investigations known to other track participants as soon as possible. General Description ------------------- A minimum of eight participating searchers, one experimental system, and one control system per site will be required. The control system can be any IR system appropriate to the goals of the local experiment, e.g. a variant of the local experimental system, some other baseline system such as SMART, ZPRISE, etc. (See "2. Augmentation" in the detailed experimental design for information about how to use more than eight searchers or more than one experimental system within this design.) Each searcher will perform eight searches on the Financial Times of London 1991-1994 collection (part of the TREC-7 adhoc collection), using eight topics especially chosen from the TREC-7 adhoc topics and modified for use in the interactive track. Each searcher will perform half of the total number of searches on the site's experimental system and the other half on its control system. The detailed experimental design (see below) determines the order in which each searcher uses the systems (experimental and control). In resolving experimental design questions not covered here (e.g., scheduling of tutorials and searches, etc.), participating sites should try to minimize the differences between the conditions under which a given searcher uses the control and those under which s/he uses the experimental system. For example, running all the control searches for a participant on one day and the searches on the experimental system on another invites unequal, confounding conditions. Topics ------ Each of the topics will describe a need for information of a particular type. Contained within the documents of the collection to be searched will be multiple distinct examples or instances of the needed information. The interactive topics will be modified versions of specially selected adhoc topics. Here is an example TREC-6 adhoc topic: Number: 303i Title: Hubble Telescope Achievements Description: Identify positive accomplishments of the Hubble telescope since it was launched in 1991. Narrative: Documents are relevant that show the Hubble telescope has produced new data, better quality data than previously available, data that has increased human knowledge of the universe, or data that has led to disproving previously existing theories or hypotheses. Documents limited to the shortcomings of the telescope would be irrelevant. Details of repairs or modifications to the telescope without reference to positive achievements would not be relevant. Here is an example of the same topic as it would be modified for use in the TREC-7 interactive track. Note the addition of the "Please save" paragraph and the removal of the usual Narrative section with its specific criteria for relevance or non-relevance: Number: 303i Title: Hubble Telescope Achievements Description: Identify positive accomplishments of the Hubble telescope since it was launched in 1991. Instances: In the time alloted, please find as many DIFFERENT positive accomplishments of the sort described above as you can. Please save at least one document for EACH such DIFFERENT accomplishment. If one document discusses several such accomplishments, then you need not save other documents that repeat those, since your goal is to identify as many DIFFERENT accomplishments of the sort described above as possible. Here are the topics for TREC-7 in NUMERICAL order. See the section "Experimental design for a site" below for their assignment to blocks and the order of presentation within the experimental design. ------------------------------------------------------------------------- Number: 352i Title: British Chunnel impacts Description: Impacts of the Chunnel - anticipated or actual - on the British economy and/or the life style of the British Instances: In the time alloted, please find as many DIFFERENT impacts of the sort described above as you can. Please save at least one document for EACH such DIFFERENT impact. If one document discusses several such impacts, then you need not save other documents that repeat those, since your goal is to identify as many DIFFERENT impacts of the sort described above as possible. ------------------------------------------------------------------------- Number: 353i Title: Antarctic exploration Description: Identify systematic explorations and scientific investigations of Antarctica, current or planned. Instances: In the time alloted, please find as many DIFFERENT explorations or investigations of the sort described above as you can.

Searchers will be encouraged to avoid saving documents which contribute no instances beyond those in documents already saved, but there will be no scoring penalty for saving such documents and searchers will be told that. Instructions to be given to searchers ------------------------------------- The following introductory instructions are to be given once to each searcher before the first search: "Imagine that you have just returned from a visit to your doctor during which it was discovered that you are suffering from high blood pressure. The doctor suggests that you take a new experimental drug, but you wonder what alternative treatments are currently available. You decide to investigate the literature on your own to satisfy your need for information about what different alternatives are available to you for high blood pressure treatment. You really need only one document for each of the different treatments for high blood pressure. You find and save a single document that lists four treatment drugs. Then you find and save another two documents that each discusses a separate alternative treatment: one that discusses the use of calcium and one that talks about regular exercise. You've run out of time and stop your search. In all, you have identified six different instances of alternative treatments in three documents. --- In this experiment, you will face a similar task. You will be presented with several descriptions of needed information on a number of topics. In each case there can be multiple examples or instances of the type of information that's needed. We would like you to identify as many different instances as you can of the needed information for each topic that will be presented to you - as many as you can in the 15 minutes you will be given to search. Please save one document for EACH DIFFERENT instance of the needed information that you identify. If you save one document that contains several instances, try not to save additional documents that contain ONLY those instances. However, you will not be penalized if you save documents unnecessarily. As you identify an instance of the needed information, please keep track of which instances you have found: write down a word or short phrase to identify the instance, or--if the system provides a facility to keep track of instances--use it. Carefully read each topic to understand the type of information needed. This will vary from topic to topic. On one topic you may be looking for instances of a certain kind of event. On another you may be searching for examples of certain sorts of people, places, or things. Do you have any questions about - what we mean by instances of needed information - the way in which you are to save nonredundant documents for each instance?" Searcher questionnaires (minimum) ----------------------- Provided by Rutgers (see track web site) Psychometric test ----------------- - FA-1 (Controlled Associations) from ETS's "Kit of Reference Tests for Cognitive Factors" (1976 Edition) Data to be collected and submitted to NIST (emailed to over@nist.gov) ------------------------------------------ Several sorts of result data will be collected for evaluation/analysis (for all searches unless otherwise specified): ===> Due at NIST by 30. August 1998: 1. sparse format data ===> Due at NIST by end of the day (Washington,DC) on 27. October 1998: 2. rich format data 3. a full narrative description of one interactive session for whichever topic is designated as T1 4. any further guidance or refinement of the task specification given to the searchers 5. data from the common searcher questionnaires 6. results from the psychometric test (FA-1) given to all searchers Sparse format data for each search will comprise the list of documents saved and the elapsed clock time of the search. The searcher's selection (choice) of items for the final output list must be identified in terms of each document's TREC document identifier (DOCNO). The elapsed (clock) time in seconds taken for the search, from the time the searcher first sees the topic until s/he declares the search to be finished, should be recorded. It is assumed that the interactive search takes place in one uninterrupted session. If a session is unavoidably interrupted, it is recommended that it be abandoned and the topic given to another searcher. Sparse format data will be the basis for the summary evaluation at NIST, which will produce a triple for each search: instance precision, instance recall, and elapsed clock time. Rich format data for each search will record: - the word or phrase each searcher records to describe each instance s/he identifies (no reference to the containing document(s)) - significant events in the course of the interaction and their timing. Rich format data are intended for analytical evaluation by the experimenters. All significant events and their timing in the course of the interaction should be recorded. The events listed below are those that seem to be fairly generally applicable to different systems and interactive environments; however, the list may need extending or modifying for specific systems and so should be taken as a suggestion rather than a requirement: o Intermediate search formulations: if appropriate to the system, these should be recorded. o Documents viewed: "viewing" is taken to mean the searcher seeing a title or some other brief information about a document; these events should be recorded. o Documents seen: "seeing" is taken to mean the searcher seeing the text of a document, or a substantial section of text; these events should be recorded. o Terms entered by the searcher: if appropriate to the system, these should be recorded. o Terms seen (offered by the system): if appropriate to the system, these should be recorded. o Selection/rejection: documents or terms selected by the user for any further stage of the search (in addition to the final selection of documents). Format of sparse data to be submitted to NIST --------------------------------------------- TWO files from each site A. Search file Here a "search" is the interaction of a searcher given a topic and asked to carry out the interactive search task using a given system against the collection - lasting at most 20 minutes. One line for EACH SEARCH, each line containing the following blank-delimited items from left to right: 1. Unique site ID 2. Search ID - site's choice (links search & document files) 3. Searcher ID - site's choice 4. System ID - site's choice 5. TREC topic number 6. Elapsed time - number of secs., fractions truncated Clock time from the moment the searcher sees the topic until the moment the searcher indicates the search is complete or time is up. B. Documents file One line for each document in a given search result, each line containing the following blank-delimited items from left to right: 1. Chronological sequence number ( "1", "2") within a search Use number of last time saved if saved multiple times. 2. Search ID (from search file) 3. TREC document identifier (DOCNO) NOTE: Reported data items listed within each line must NOT contain whitespace. Format of other data to be submitted to NIST -------------------------------------------- Data other than that in sparse-format should be submitted as ASCII text files. The FA-1 score plus the questionaire data for each searcher should be submitted in a separate file with format close to the following example but with the real responses to the right of the colons. The Tutorial Worksheet and Experimenter Note need not be submitted. S i t e: S e a r c h e r I D: FA-1 score: ? P r e - s e a r c h : (1 per searcher) Searcher: id Condition: ?

Q8: ... Q9: ... Evaluation of data submitted to NIST ------------------------------------ Evaluation by NIST of the sparse format data will proceed as follows. For each topic, a pool will be formed containing the unique documents saved by at least one searcher for that topic regardless of site. For each topic, the NIST assessor, normally the topic author, will be asked to: - read the topic carefully - read each of the documents from the pool for that topic and gradually: - create a list of instances of the topic's needed information type found somewhere in the documents - select and record a short phrase describing each instance found - determine which documents contain which instances - bracket each instance in the text of the document in which it was found For each search (by a given participant for a given topic at a given site), NIST will use the submitted list of selected documents and the assessor's instance-document mapping for the topic to calculate: - the fraction of total instances (as determined by the assessor) for the topic that are covered by the submitted documents (i.e., instance recall) - the fraction of the submitted documents which contain one or more instances (i.e., instance precision) The third measure, elapsed clock time, will be taken directly from the submitted results for each search. Experimental design for a site ------------------------------ 1. Minimal experimental matrix as run Define two blocks of four topics each, order of presentation fixed within each block: B1 = T1 -> T2 -> T3 -> T4 365i 357i 362i 352i B2 = T5 -> T6 -> T7 -> T8 366i 392i 387i 353i Participants | System,Topic --------------+-------------------- P1 | E,B1 C,B2 P2 | C,B2 E,B1 P3 | E,B2 C,B1 P4 | C,B1 E,B2 P5 | E,B1 C,B2 P6 | C,B2 E,B1 P7 | E,B2 C,B1 P8 | C,B1 E,B2 or expanded to show the individual topics: Participants | System,Topic combinations --------------+--------------------------------------------------- P1 | E,T1 E,T2 E,T3 E,T4 C,T5 C,T6 C,T7 C,T8 P2 | C,T5 C,T6 C,T7 C,T8 E,T1 E,T2 E,T3 E,T4 P3 | E,T5 E,T6 E,T7 E,T8 C,T1 C,T2 C,T3 C,T4 P4 | C,T1 C,T2 C,T3 C,T4 E,T5 E,T6 E,T7 E,T8 P5 | E,T1 E,T2 E,T3 E,T4 C,T5 C,T6 C,T7 C,T8 P6 | C,T5 C,T6 C,T7 C,T8 E T1 E,T2 E,T3 E,T4 P7 | E,T5 E,T6 E,T7 E,T8 C,T1 C,T2 C,T3 C,T4 P8 | C,T1 C,T2 C,T3 C,T4 E,T5 E,T6 E,T7 E,T8 - E = experimental system - C = Control system - site's choice - The participants (searchers) should be numbered sequentially, 1, ..., J. J must be at least 8 (see part 4 below on how to add more) Each site will randomly assign participants to the rows of its design. The order for presentation of topics to searchers at all participating sites is defined by the above design. The assignment of actual topics to T1, T2, ... T8 will be determined by NIST in collaboration with the track shortly after the interactive topics are made available. For the purposes of analysis each 4-person-by-8-topic matrix defined above will in effect be rearranged by permuting the columns (topics) so E alternates with C as in the following: Participants | System,Topic combinations --------------+--------------------------------------------------- P1 | E,T1 C,T5 E,T2 C,T6 E,T3 C,T7 E,T4 C,T8 P2 | C,T5 E,T1 C,T6 E,T2 C,T7 E,T3 C,T8 E,T4 P3 | E,T5 C,T1 E,T6 C,T2 E,T7 C,T3 E,T8 C,T4 P4 | C,T1 E,T5 C,T2 E,T6 C,T3 E,T7 C,T4 E,T8 Note that this matrix consists of the following 2x2 subdesign: E C C E This 2x2 design is a latin square design. It has the property that the "treatment effect", here E-C, the control-adjusted response, can be estimated free and clear of the main (additive) effects of participant and topic. Here, participant and topic are treated statistically as blocking factors. This means that even in the presence of differences between participants and topics, which clearly are anticipated, the design will provide estimates of E-C that are not contaminated by these differences. However, the estimate of E-C is contaminated by the presence of an interaction between topic and participant. Therefore, we replicate the 2x2 latin square 4x4 times to get the minimal 8x8 design for each site. The contaminating effect of the topic by participant interaction is reduced by averaging the sixteen estimates of E-C that are available, one for each 2x2 latin square. This is analogous to averaging replicate measurements of a single quantity in order to reduce the measurement uncertainty. 2. Augmentation The design for a given site can be augmented in two ways: 1. Participants can be added by in groups of 4 using the design for P1-4 (above). 2. Systems can be added by repeating the 8x8 design with at least one new system. Topics cannot be added/subtracted individually for each site. All augmentations other than the two listed above, however interesting, are outside the scope of this design. If sites plan such adjunct experiments, they are encouraged to design them for maximal synergy with the track design. 3. Analysis Up to each group, but all are strongly encouraged to take advantage of the experimental design and undertake: 1. exploratory data analysis to examine the patterns of correlation, interaction, etc. involving the major factors. Some example plots for the TREC-6 interactive data (recall or precision by searcher or topic) are available on the Interactive Track web site at www-nlpir.nist.gov/~over/t7i under "Interactive Track History". 2. analysis of variance (ANOVA), where appropriate, to estimate the separate contributions of searcher, topic and system as a first step in understanding why the results of one search are different from those of another.

Hubble celebrates 15th anniversary with spectacular new images
  Whirlpool Galaxy M51
  25 April 2005
In the 15 years that the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope has orbited Earth, it has taken three-quarters of a million photographs of the cosmos. Two new views have been released of Hubble's most well-known images: the Whirlpool Galaxy, M51, and the Eagle Nebula, M16.   The new images released for Hubble’s 15th anniversary are among the largest and sharpest views Hubble has ever taken, and were made with Hubble's Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS). The new Whirlpool Galaxy image shows the spiral galaxy's classic features, from its curving arms, where newborn stars reside, to its yellowish central core that serves as home for older stars. The new Eagle Nebula image reveals a tall, dense tower of gas being sculpted by ultraviolet light from a group of massive, hot stars. NASA’s Space Shuttle Discovery launched Hubble into space on 24 April 1990 and placed it into orbit a day after, thereby opening a brand new era in astronomy. For the first time ever, a large telescope that viewed in visible light orbited above Earth's distorting atmosphere, which blurs starlight and make images appear fuzzy. After installation of a new camera and a device that compensated for an improperly ground mirror, images of planets, stars, galaxies, and nebula began pouring in – all up to 10 times sharper than any previous telescope had ever delivered.     Long list of scientific achievements
  During 15 years of viewing the sky, Hubble has taken more than 700000 exposures of more than 22 000 celestial objects. The spacecraft itself has whirled around Earth nearly 88 000 times, travelling more than 4000 million kilometres. The orbiting observatory generates enough data every day - about 15 gigabytes - to fill more than three DVDs, and in total it has produced 23 terabytes of data, equal to the amount of text in 23 million novels. Over 3900 astronomers from all over the world have used the telescope, and compiled a long list of scientific achievements, published in more than 4000 papers, such as: - calculating the precise age of the Universe to be 13 700 million years old); - confirming the existence of a strange form of energy called dark energy; - detecting small ‘proto-galaxies’ that emitted their light when the Universe was less than a 1000 million years old; - proving the existence of ‘super-massive black holes’; - seeing a comet hitting Jupiter; and - showing that the process of forming planetary systems is common throughout the galaxy.     The Whirlpool Galaxy
  The two winding arms of the majestic Whirlpool spiral galaxy M51 (NGC 5194) are actually long lanes of stars and gas laced with dust, a hallmark of so-called ‘grand-design’ spiral galaxies. Located 31 million light-years away in the constellation Canes Venatici (the Hunting Dogs), the Whirlpool's face-on view and closeness to Earth allow astronomers to study a classic spiral galaxy's structure and star-forming processes. Some astronomers believe that the Whirlpool's arms are so prominent because of the effects of a close encounter with NGC 5195, the small, yellowish galaxy at the outermost tip of one of the Whirlpool's arms. At first glance, the compact galaxy appears to be tugging on the arm. Hubble's clear view, however, shows that NGC 5195 is passing behind the Whirlpool. The small galaxy has been gliding past the Whirlpool for hundreds of millions of years.     Eagle Nebula M16
The Eagle Nebula
  A soaring tower of cold gas and dust about 9.5 light-years high, which is twice the distance from the Sun to our nearest star, rises from a stellar nursery called the Eagle Nebula, M16. Inside the gaseous tower, stars may be forming. Some of the stars may have been created by dense gas collapsing under gravity. Other stars may be forming due to pressure from gas that has been heated by the neighbouring hot stars. The tower's rough surface is illuminated by starlight and is silhouetted against the background glow of more distant gas. The colours in this image were produced by gas energised by the star cluster's powerful ultraviolet light. The blue colour at the top is from glowing oxygen and the red in the lower region is from glowing hydrogen.     Send this page to a friend       More about...

Hubble and the Messier objects
The Hubble Space Telescope and the Messier objects [hst.jpg]
The famous Hubble Space Telescope is certainly one of the most innovative tools of the astronomers in the 1990s decade; the present author is just now going to predict (and is convinced it deserves) that it might win the title "Photographer of the Decade" for the 1990, as Voyager 2 was nominated for the 1980. Its most spectacular results, together with an open and intelligent public relations policy of the Space Telescope Science Institute, has provided astronomers with a great flood of data and high-quality images, and an outstanding popularity, especially as all the materials get public domain two years after they were obtained. The Hubble results have revolutionized the state of knowledge in virtually any branch of astronomy -- not that every good result comes from the HST, but as these data are available publicly, they are used if ever possible; from planets, comets, and asteroids to stars, clusters, nebulae, and galaxies, every sort of objects in the sky were investigated, often obtaining most revolutionary results. Among the most outstanding achievements are observations of objects from Messier's catalog, as those are outstanding representatives of all types of Deep-Sky objects. Because not every author has made his results available to the public domain, we cannot present a comprehensive review here at the moment. But we have tried to link into our catalog some of the most interesting achievements. There's but one fact on the Hubble Telescope's optics which must be kept in mind: The Hubble telescope has a very long focal length of 190 feet (58 m), and thus a one degree field measures one full meter in the space telescope's focal plane, and one arc minute about 1.7 cm. As its detectors are very much smaller, their fields of view are actually small, so that only photos of small portions of extended objects like most of Messier's catalog can be obtained. Moreover, the Hubble Space Telescope is not only an astronomical instrument (though the telescope makes up its biggest part) but also a sophisticated spacecraft. As a spacecraft, it has proven to be very reliable, and was so well operated that the technological operations did virtually never concern the scientific program (at least up to November 1999 when it shut down itself because the fourth of 6 gyroscopes failed - only to be recovered in the third servicing mission, STS-103, in December 1999). The Hubble Space Telescope (HST) was originally projected under the name "Large Space Telescope" (LST) and then simply "Space Telescope" (ST), and developed since the 1970s. Indeed, Hubble is one of the more important in a considerably long list of orbiting telescopes, or astronomy satellites. It is the second of four in a NASA series of large orbiting observatories, observing in the visible light, together with the Compton Gamma Ray Telescope (CGRO) observing in Gamma-ray light, the Chandra X-ray Observatory (CXO), and the Spitzer Space Telescope (SST)
observing in Infrared. Here's a list of links to the Hubble observations of Messier objects we could collect with our pages: M1: Jeff Hester

by the crew of the Shutle mission STS-61 in December 1993. Moreover, this galaxy is the home of the first Cepheid variables discovered in the Virgo cluster of galaxies, giving a distance of 50-60 million light years, and a Hubble constant of 80+/-17. However, with the refinement of the distance scale by ESA's astrometric Hipparcos satellite, this value must be refined by about 10 percent, and current estimates for H0 are closer to 67+/-7. M104: Hubble Mosaic of the Majestic Sombrero Galaxy. M105: Central Massive Dark Object
(Jan 1997) We know of more good Hubble results concerning Messier objects. They are listed below, and we would like to get images and more information for inclusion here: M95
was a target within the key project of searching for Cepheid variables in neighboring galaxies. We are still looking for Hubble images of this galaxy though. M101: The distance of M101 has been determined as 24 million light years (27 if corrected for Hipparcos data), again with Cepheids. A HST image of M101 was in a semi-recent issue of Astronomy magazine. Also, there were older images which are not yet on SEDS, e.g. in the slide sets of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific, including more photos of M42, M77, M87, and others which still await being included here. Some Hubble images of non-Messier objects have also found their way into our service: NGC 2903

[SpaceDaily Frontpage]
SPACE WIRE Hubble Space Telescope turns 15, with a galaxy of achievements WASHINGTON (AFP) Apr 26, 2005 The Hubble Space Telescope turned 15 Monday, with 750,000 photographs of deep space and Earth to its credit, but its future is now uncertain. Hubble was launched by the Space Shuttle Discovery on April 25, 1990, and opened a new era in astronomy. However, the telescope, a cooperative effort of NASA and the European Space Agency, would not be operational until three years later. A mirror that had been improperly ground was corrected in 1993, when a new camera was also installed in the first repair mission by a space shuttle. Once repaired, the telescope beamed back photographs 10 times sharper than ever before of galaxies, supernovas, giant explosions marking the death of a star and the birth of a black hole. Thanks to Hubble, flying above the atmospheric distortion that hinders even more powerful Earth-based telescopes, scientists have been able to confirm that the universe is rapidly expanding and to calculate precisely its age, at 13.7 billion years, according to NASA. Among other achievements, Hubble's observations allowed scientists to confirm the existence of a strange form of energy called dark energy; proved the existence of super-massive black holes; provided sharp views of a comet hitting Jupiter; and showed that the process of forming planetary systems is common throughout the galaxy, NASA said in a statement. NASA has so far decided not to send a shuttle to repair the aging Hubble, citing the 450 million dollars it would cost to do so. But the space agency's new chief, Michael Griffin, has said he would revisit the decision. Astronauts have serviced Hubble four times, and many scientists hoped that a fifth service mission would be funded to enable Hubble to function to 2011, when its infrared replacement, the James Webb Space Telescope, is scheduled to arrive. Currently, it is believed that Hubble's aging solar cells will provide enough energy to survive to 2007. All rights reserved. © 2005 Agence France-Presse.

By Leonard David, SPACE.com A White House decision to cut funding for a Hubble Space Telescope servicing mission and dump the observatory into a remote stretch of ocean waters at a future date is sure to incite debate in scientific, engineering, and policy making circles. The Hubble Space Telescope snaps a view of Senegal. The telescope is in need of service, which is not in the current NASA budget.
NASA/JSC
Intensive work has been underway at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center to develop telerobotic servicing skills for the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) in the event that a space shuttle crew is never again sent to the orbiting facility. Aerospace firms in the United States and in Canada have teamed with NASA to develop a Hubble Robotic Vehicle Deorbit Module. Either a robotic or shuttle-based servicing option reportedly would cost in excess of $1 billion. That pricetag is viewed by the White House, according to sources, as not affordable given other high-priority and more expensive efforts, such as the return-to-flight of the space shuttle program, as well as moving forward on NASA's Moon, Mars and beyond agenda. White House plans to scuttle Hubble is part of NASA's 2006 budget request, sources said, with some money in the budget allocated to using a propulsion module coupled to Hubble for its safe but destructive deorbiting. The cutting of the HST servicing mission from NASA's 2006 budget request was first reported by Space News on its Web site Friday and on SPACE.com. Leading the fight
Senator Barbara Mikulski (D-Md.), a fervent Hubble supporter whose state is home to both the Goddard Space Flight Center and the Space Telescope Science Institute, issued a statement late January 21 in which she vowed to continue advocating an HST servicing mission. "It is essential that we have a safe and reliable servicing mission to Hubble," Mikulski said, that is consistent with the findings of the Columbia Accident Investigation Board and last month's findings of a National Academy of Sciences (NAS) panel on the Hubble issue. On December 8, in the NAS final report released by the Committee on the Assessment of Options for Extending the Life of the Hubble Space Telescope, a blue ribbon group of experts said that NASA should reinstate a space shuttle mission to refurbish the Earth-orbiting telescope. "I led the fight to add $300 million to NASA's budget last year for a Hubble servicing mission, and I plan to lead the fight again this year. This is what the American people expect and deserve," Mikulski said in a statement. In defense of Hubble
Response to the White House decision has engendered a wait-and-see attitude in some astronomical quarters, while others have been quick to react. Hubble's best days lie ahead, predicted John Bahcall, a professor of natural sciences at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey. In 1998, he was a recipient of the National Medal of Science for his pioneering efforts in neutrino astrophysics and his contributions to the development and planning of the Hubble Space Telescope. "President Nixon cancelled in 1973 the Hubble Telescope while it was still in the development phase. The reason was similar: other activities in the NASA budget took priority," Bahcall told SPACE.com. "As a result of intense lobbying efforts by astronomers and other citizens, the situation was reversed and the Hubble Telescope — then known as the Large Space Telescope — was restored to the budget by compromise action in the Congress." Bahcall said that Hubble has contributed enormously to scientific knowledge and to America's respect abroad. The telescope represents achievements of which all Americans can be proud, he said. "I am confident that Americans of all walks of life will come to the defense of the Hubble and cause the Congress to restore the repair of the telescope to the NASA budget," Bahcall said. Telerobotic progress
Excellent progress is being made on a telerobotic approach to servicing the Hubble, said Jim Crocker, vice president of civil space at Lockheed Martin Space Systems of Denver. The firm has supported NASA's planning and then repair and servicing of the HST via four space shuttle missions to date. The telerobotics team at work at Goddard Space Flight Center "have a good shot at pulling this off," Crocker told SPACE.com the day before the Space News story on the White House HST decision appeared. Lockheed Martin's role in the rocket-launched Hubble Robotic Vehicle Deorbit Module (HRVDM), Crocker said, is providing all the sensors to do the rendezvous and docking with the Hubble, as well as provide the liquid-fueled propellant module that would later deorbit the telescope. For their part, Canada's MacDonald, Dettwiler and Associates (MDA) Ltd. — through its MD Robotics group in Brampton, Ontario — is providing the Dextre robot that's part of the HRVDM. It is being specially configured to replace batteries, gyroscopes, and perhaps an instrument on the HST to extend its life. NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center is overseeing and integrating the HRVDM work. Crocker said that simulations performed at NASA's Goddard Space Flight center have converted doubters, including him, that performing many of the scheduled Hubble servicing tasks through the tender loving care of telerobotics is feasible. "That's not to say it's not challenging," Crocker said, "but the team is making a convincing story." Rabbit out of the hat
There's also good news to report in keeping Hubble in an operating mode. Worry centers on HST's gyroscopes, batteries, or other gear that might fail early, negating the observatory's useful lifetime. "The team continues to pull rabbits out of the hat," Crocker said. For instance, a two gyro science mode, along with the needed software has been worked out. HST's original design had to have three gyros working to do science. Additionally, a new battery management approach is being adopted. "That's good news," Crocker said. "I'm hearing we're likely to be able to get [HST] into 2008 now." At the end of the day, Crocker concluded, whatever option is decided upon for Hubble servicing and its ultimate reentry, "everyone on the team wants the best chance of success possible."

The Hubble Space Telescope
by Jim Slotta Scientist
Telescopes have come a long way since the days of Galileo! Over the years, larger and larger telescopes were constructed in order to capture the light from more and more distant stars. Still, no matter how large a lens or mirror was used, there was always a problem with any telescope located on the surface of the earth, as the earth's atmosphere tends to block or absorb some of the starlight. Because the light from distant stars is very faint to begin with, this interference from the atmosphere became a serious problem as scientists looked further and further out into space. For decades, astronomers longed for a telescope that was free from the earth's atmospheric blockade -- on the surface of the moon, perhaps, or in orbit around the earth as a satellite. In 1993, they were finally rewarded, as NASA engineers delivered the orbiting Hubble Space Telescope: (Medium, 57K)
Originally, the giant light-collecting mirror of the Hubble was slightly out of shape, which meant that the images of far-off stars were out of focus. But when space shuttle astronauts repaired this problem in December of 1993, a whole new chapter in the book of astronomy had begun. One newspaper reporter wrote: "The Hubble Space Telescope, once blurry and the butt of jokes, has been repaired, making it sharp enough to see two fireflies 10 feet apart in Tokyo from Washington DC. It is sensitive enough to detect their individual flashes." --The San Fransisco Examiner
The Hubble can look at galaxies which are very old as described in an article from Philadelphia's daily newspaper, the Philadelphia Inquirer.: "...scientists announced they had pictures of galaxies so distant that the light from them had taken billions of years to reach Hubble's cameras. The telescope was therefore seeing how the galaxies looked when they were young-it was watching the past unfold." --The Philadelphia Inquirer
(Check out the Philadelphia Inquirer article to learn all about the Hubble telescope, including some of its major successes as a scientific instrument.) Evidence Information KEYWORDS Telescope, Hubble, Light, Space, Astronomy SUBMITTER Philip Bell Additional Information METHODS The evidence combines NASA photos of the Hubble with a quote from a newspaper and an informative article about the Hubble telescope's history and various achievements. This informative article, written by a Philadelphia Inquirer reporter, contains some interesting links to other related Web sites. INSPIRATION This evidence about the Hubble Space Telescope was assembled in order to provide some information about the problems with conventional telescopes and how they have been overcome. PROJECTS How Far Does Light Go? GUIDANCE - Why does the fact that the Hubble is outside of the Earth's atmosphere make a difference in what it allows us to see? - Does the fact that the Hubble can see light from galaxies which has traveled in space for billions of years support either theory in the debate? - How far away can the Hubble see stars? What does that say about the light coming from these stars? - The article tells us that the Hubble has allowed astronomers to learn more about distant galaxies. Why does it say the Hubble was seeing the galaxies as they appeared when they were very young? - Could a telescope on the earth's surface with a really huge and precise mirror or lens detect the things the Hubble is detecting? Why or why not? COMPREHENSION TIME 5 to 20 minutes SCIENCE LEVEL Middle School and Above KIE Evidence. Copyright © 1996-7 The KIE Group.

Insurance Group Names Most Dangerous Vehicles 03.16.2005
By James M. Flammang
According to the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety
(IIHS), a version of the Chevrolet Blazer
may be the most unsafe vehicle to be found on American roads. Based on the Institute's study of 1999-2002 passenger vehicles, the two-door, two-wheel-drive Blazer had the highest rate of driver deaths, in both single-vehicle and multiple-vehicle accidents. While the average annual driver death rate was 87 per million registered vehicles, the two-door Blazer averaged 308 deaths per million. Rollover accidents also topped the list of 199 vehicle models, at 251 per million. Models with the highest death rates are "mostly small cars and mid-sized SUVs," the Institute asserted. The list of vehicles with high rates also included the Mitsubishi Mirage
two-door sedan, with 209 driver deaths per million vehicles, followed by the Pontiac Firebird, subcompact Kia Rio, and first-generation Kia Sportage
with two-wheel drive. Several sport-utility vehicles showed low rates. Judged by IIHS results, the safest vehicle of all could be the Mercedes-Benz E-Class
sedan, with a driver death rate of 10 per million. Next came the Toyota 4Runner
midsize SUV, Volkswagen Passat
sedan, and Lexus RX 300
(another midsize SUV). Also on the list vehicles with low death rates was the Toyota RAV4, which is a compact sport-utility vehicle. Several of the models with high driver death rates have already ceased production, and the Blazer is being phased out of Chevrolet's lineup. Kia now markets a completely different Sportage model. General Motors responded to the IIHS report by stating that the Blazer was properly tested while in production. GM also questions "what role driver behavior, such as drunk driving and driving without a safety belt, played in these deaths." Trucks, according to a GM statement, are driven more than cars, "often on secondary roads where more rollover crashes occur." The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, which conducts crash tests and engages in safety research, is affiliated with the insurance industry.

Sure it guzzles gas, blocks visibility and is a rather inefficient method of moving singles around a metropolitan area, but "the world's most dangerous vehicle"? Give me a break! Carmudgeon
Why Do You Hate the SUV?
Date Posted 11-01-2002 This month's topic comes courtesy of the September 16, 2002, issue of Automotive News
(with a follow-up story covering the same topic in the October 7 issue). Before getting into the meat of my discussion, I think it bears mentioning that, despite the title, Automotive News
is not a 100-percent, over-the-top, prays-to-the-gods-of-internal-combustion, pro-automotive periodical. This publication, which arrives in my mailbox every Monday morning, generally does an adequate job of presenting both sides of any given topic related to the industry in which I work. However, after reading the "Chorus of SUV critics grows louder" story in the September 16 issue, and then the "Author bases anti-SUV conclusions on statistics" article from the October 7 issue, I felt it was time to address this latest anti-SUV tirade. As someone who finds plenty wrong with the current SUV situation, as chronicled in my column last March, you SUV haters can rest easy knowing I'm never going to defend any of the hypocrites who buy an SUV when they don't need one. What I am going to defend is every American's right to buy an SUV if he wants to, whether he needs it or not.
In both of the Automotive News
stories I've referenced above a gentleman named Keith Bradsher is cited as leading the charge to educate consumers about the real dangers of SUVs. Mr. Bradsher's book, High and Mighty ? SUVs: The World's Most Dangerous Vehicles and How They Got That Way
has an interesting title, though I wonder if "High and Mighty" refers to SUVs or the liberal intelligentsia that often goes around this country trying to "protect us from ourselves for our own good." In this case, I'm inclined to believe the latter simply because Mr. Bradsher partakes of the exact same type of double-talk he claims to be fighting against. Specifically, Mr. Bradsher takes issue with how the automakers paint SUVs as safe, rugged off-road vehicles capable of providing fun and adventure to their owners, even though most of those owners will never go off-road. He thinks the poor American consumer is being duped into buying SUVs by the big, mean automakers that are only interested in making a profit off of these rolling death traps that use too much gas. According to the October 7 issue of Automotive News, Bradsher thinks automakers "manipulate automotive journalists by setting up press events for sport-utilities in exotic off-road locations when they know the vehicle won't be driven that way." It further states "this distracts reviewers from evaluating the vehicles where most people drive them." Wow, and I always thought my staff did a pretty good job of identifying how even the most capable off-road vehicles will rarely be driven off-road by the average owner. Now I learn that my entire editorial team has been carefully "manipulated" by those dastardly automakers. (Can you hear the "protecting us from ourselves" overtones yet?) Thankfully, we all have someone like Mr. Bradsher to shine the light of truth on this otherwise dark and sinister plot, right? Well, not really. When Bradsher says that SUVs use more gas than other types of vehicles, he's generally correct, although many compact, and even some midsize SUVs, can get better mileage than midsize and larger sedans. But where Bradsher clearly crosses the line into deceitful reporting is his assertions that SUVs are inherently dangerous. Indeed, the title of his book calls them "The World's Most Dangerous Vehicles." If you're hearing echoes of Ralph Nader's exuberantly alarmist Unsafe at Any Speed
book from 40 years ago, you're on the right track. To justify his branding of SUVs as the modern-day Corvair, Bradsher points to accident and injury rates that show SUVs being involved in more crashes than full-size sedans or minivans. He specifically cited this point in an interview on Fox's "The O'Reilly Factor" with Bill O'Reilly. But as anyone with basic PR training knows, you can make statistics say whatever you want them to. Saying that SUVs are more dangerous than full-size sedans simply because they are involved in more accidents is like saying people who fly on airplanes are more likely to die in an air disaster when compared to people who never fly. That statement may seem overly simplistic but, remember, people on the ground occasionally die in air disasters, too. The point is that the nature of the driver (just like the nature of people who do or don't fly) is critically important in both arguments. To put it another way, look at the type of people who drive full-size sedans and minivans. In case you don't already know, full-sedans, like the Ford Crown Victoria, Buick Regal or Toyota Avalon, tend to be driven by people over 50. And minivans tend to be driven by parents transporting children (increasingly, minivans are also being driven by people over 50 who have discovered how convenient those huge sliding doors are when it comes time to get in and out of the vehicle ? my in-laws and their Oldsmobile Silhouette being a perfect example). SUVs, on the other hand, tend to be driven by young people, and they often serve as a sort of rolling party because they can carry many bodies (like a minivan) and they have a cool image (pretty much the opposite of a minivan). Yes, lots of housewives have traded in their minivans for an SUV in recent years. But minivans accounted for just over one million in U.S. sales last year, while SUVs accounted for nearly four million. Obviously, it's not just suburban moms who buy these high-profile vehicles. So you have grandparents and parents almost exclusively driving large sedans and minivans, while over in SUV land you have plenty of young, single people carrying all their friends to and from the latest social gathering. And, lo and behold, SUVs have a higher accident rate and injury rate than large sedans and minivans. Bradsher seems to have left this minor point out of his various media interviews. I'd hate to suggest he's using deceptive tactics to make a point and sell a product (sort of like touting the off-road prowess of certain vehicles that will likely never go off-road) but, oh, what the hell, I'm gonna say it anyway. And I'll present this counter argument to Bradsher: If you take two equally skilled, competent and intelligent drivers, and put one in a Lincoln Navigator and the other in a Lincoln LS, the driver in the Navigator is less likely to suffer serious injuries from a traffic accident. Keep in mind that competent and intelligent drivers always wear their seatbelt and understand that SUVs don't handle like a sports car. Or try this one on for size: You have just been told by the Great Spirit that in the next seven days you will be involved in a serious traffic accident. You don't know where, you don't know when, and you don't know the specific nature of the crash, but it will happen. The only factor you can control is what vehicle you will be driving for the next week ? Cadillac Escalade, Honda Odyssey or Toyota Avalon. Which one do you pick, Mr. Bradsher? Keep in mind that the two vehicles you don't
pick will also be involved in the accident. If Bradsher wants to make an argument that it's easier for bad drivers to crash in an SUV than in a minivan, I might actually go along with that argument. But that doesn't make the SUV "the world's most dangerous vehicle," it simply proves what we already knew: even a large, heavy vehicle can't save lousy drivers from themselves. Another point Bradsher fails to mention is the increasingly carlike nature of SUVs. In the last two years, Ford's best-selling SUVs, the Explorer and Expedition, went from riding on a solid rear axle to utilizing an independent rear suspension. This move greatly increased the stability of both vehicles. How do we know this? Well, beyond simple logic and some instrumented testing under controlled conditions, one of our editors recently had to perform a rapid lane change maneuver in our long-term Explorer
after an accident happened right in front of him on a Los Angeles freeway. He swerved hard left and then hard right, recreating the exact driving style that had previous Ford Explorers going rubber side up. In this instance, the 2002 Explorer remained stable and composed. Once again, not bad for being one of "the world's most dangerous vehicles," huh? I'll concede Bradsher's point that most SUV owners never go off-road, and I agree with him that automakers (especially domestic automakers) have more to gain by selling high-priced, high-profit SUVs instead of lower-priced cars. But, as is usually the case, market forces are addressing these issues. Today's SUV buyers demand a more refined and stable vehicle. Foreign automakers were the first ones to offer carlike SUVs, but the domestic manufacturers are quickly catching up (with models like the redesigned Explorer and Expedition). As for vehicle emissions and gas mileage, SUVs are making rapid advances in both areas as well. Honda's new Pilot already has ULEV (ultra low emissions vehicle) certification, and it gets 17/22 miles-per-gallon in city/highway driving (numbers not far behind the minivans and full-size sedans Bradsher has such an affinity for). What Bradsher and the rest of this country's SUV haters need to realize is that the genie is out of the bottle. Fifteen years ago most Americans didn't know what an SUV was, and they certainly didn't realize the kind of people-/cargo-carrying capacity such vehicles offered. They also didn't know how reassuring it feels to sit high above the road surface. Now every American over the age of 10 has either driven or ridden in an SUV, and while most may not like the tippy handling or harsh ride over broken pavement, they love the "king of the road" sensation and versatile seating/cargo options. They also like knowing that, if they wanted to, they could scamper away from the beaten path for an off-road adventure. Unlike Mr. Frost, most will never actually take that road less traveled, but we Americans like having our options open. Once again, I want to emphasize that SUVs are not for everyone, and, like any good American, I don't support single, city-dwelling, white-collar professionals, especially ones that rarely carry more than a briefcase or purse and never go off-road, buying seven-passenger vehicles that get less than 20 mpg. However, my reasoning relates to efficiency and geopolitical circumstances (it'd be good not to further grow our dependence on imported oil). However, I'm not going to sell the public a bunch of misinformation about SUVs being inherently unsafe because, well, they aren't. I also don't appreciate all the hypocritical Hollywood "environmentalists" who claim allegiance to Mother Earth?from the cockpits of their Range Rovers, Navigators and Hummer H2s. Of course, regardless of my or Bradsher's desire to see fewer SUVs on the road, the truth is that these vehicles are not going away. They will undoubtedly continue to get even safer, more refined and more fuel-efficient, but they will never disappear from the American landscape. If that thought bothers you, well, now you know how I've felt for the past two decades about rap music. Rather ironic, actually, when you consider the growing bond between certain SUVs and rap music. But hey, at least SUVs will be getting more
refined as the years pass.

Blazer Most Dangerous Vehicle, Insurance Study Finds March 15, 2005
The Mercedes E-Class sedan is the safest car on the highway, while the least safe is the two-door Chevrolet Blazer, according to a study by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS). The institute reached its conclusions about the Mercedes, Blazer and 197 other relatively popular vehicles by studying driver death rates of 1999 to 2002 model cars and trucks from 2000 to 2003. Among four-door midsize cars, the Volkswagen Passat performed best, with an average of 16 driver deaths per million registered vehicles annually, but the Chrysler Sebring had 126 driver deaths. Among midsize sport utility vehicles with four-wheel drive, the Toyota 4Runner had 12 deaths per million registered vehicles annually, compared with 134 for the two-door Ford Explorer. The study focused on the rate of driver deaths in various types of crashes, including both single- and multiple-vehicle accidents. The overall driver death rate, for 199 models studied during the 2000-2003 calendar years, was 87 per million registered vehicles annually, the institute said. The Blazer had an average of 308 driver deaths per million. It also had the highest rate of driver deaths in rollover accidents at 251 per million. "Large cars and minivans dominate among vehicle models with very low death rates" while those with the highest fatality rates are "mostly small cars and small and midsize SUVs," the study said The Results Lowest Rates of Driver Death

Why an SUV is now the most dangerous vehicle in Iraq
Patrick Graham in Baghdad Sunday April 4, 2004 The Observer
It has become clear in the past few years that four-wheel-drive SUVs are some of the most dangerous vehicles on the road. Nowhere is this more true than in Iraq. In almost every deadly attack on foreign civilians, the victims have been in Sport Utility Vehicles, almost invariably white: the occupation car of choice. The burning wreckage in Falluja last week was unmistakable. The charred bodies of the four Americans were scattered around two white SUVs. The men - Scott Helvenston, from Florida, a producer of extreme fitness videos; Jerry Zovko from Ohio; Wesley Batalona, 48, from Hawaii; and wrestling coach Michael Teague, 38, from Tennessee - were former US special forces members now working for Blackwater, a private security firm that protects Paul Bremer, the coalition's administrator. Falluja is a centre of the anti-American resistance, where even the police don't support the Americans. US soldiers don't drive through Falluja much. When they do, they have helicopter back-up and heavy armour. 'Almost every foreigner who has been killed here is an idiot,' said one ex-Navy SEAL. Soldiers often show little sympathy for those who fail to follow the right procedure. He began listing their mistakes. To start with, they were in Falluja, in an SUV. Next, he guessed they had gone through the city before and had met no problems, but were seen leaving an American base - a routine can kill you. Later, they were followed. 'People don't realise that this is war,' he said. But last week's horrific scenes in Falluja give the wrong impression. Iraq is, in fact, a lot safer than it was last summer. There is less violence now but it is better organised, more methodical. Especially in the capital. You can tell a lot about the security situation in Baghdad by listening to the city. Last summer, there was almost constant gunfire. The city was in chaos and murders and robbery were common. Today, there are police on the streets and it is much safer. The problem is that, while the police presence reduces some kinds of crime, there is nobody in control of the city. For a careful criminal, there are no consequences. The other day, we drove by a café in which gangsters hang out. If someone wants to kill you, this is where they can go. It costs $100 to have someone shot. The killers know they will never be caught. For all the media reports about foreign deaths, life is far more dangerous for Iraqis, especially Iraqis who work for foreigners. And while three journalists have been killed in the past month, they have all been killed by the American army. And they were Arab or Iraqi. This is what Iraqis complain about when they say ' maku amin ', no security. If you anger somebody, he can kill you with impunity. A foreign newspaper bureau here recently tried to fire one of its guards for sleeping on the job. A driver quietly explained that, if the guard were fired, he would hire someone to take revenge. The guard stayed. If you can't threaten someone with a vendetta, then you have very little leverage in negotiations. As a result, the tribeless Christian community has been one of the worst hit by kidnappers. In Baghdad, we listen to bombs exploding rather than chaotic gunfire. One woke us up last week, rattling the windows, blowing in the curtains. Five Iraqis were killed. What were they driving? An SUV. ·
Two attacks on Iraqi police south of Baghdad yesterday left four dead, bringing to 350 the number of policemen killed by shooting and suicide bombings in the past year. Special report

“WHAT WOULD SATAN DRIVE?” AND OTHER UNFAIR QUESTIONS ABOUT SUVs The SUV Problem—Hating Them is Too Simplistic
Given a choice, we suspect that Satan would enjoy driving any vehicle with a Burst Into Flames feature. In any event, should today's SUV drivers be condemned to Dante's 7th circle of Hell (the one known as "Yugo")? SUV bashing has become a popular sport among some. SUVs typically get poor gas mileage, they pollute more than cars, they're more [picture of pristine mountain lake]
dangerous in crashes (both for their occupants and especially for drivers of other vehicles). All these things are true. But in some ways, it is too simplistic to say that SUVs are bad and cars are good. For instance, how many of us are driving the most fuel-efficient, least polluting vehicle available on the market? In addition, other factors—such as how far we choose to commute to work, whether or not we carpool, whether or not we combine trips for errands, whether we're still driving a 15-year-old "blue smoker"—all play a role in determining our personal "driving impact" on the environment. If environmental impact is evaluated for all drivers, SUV owners are likely to score more poorly because of the gas-mileage deficit of the typical SUV as compared to a car. Don't forget, though—some SUVs get better gas mileage than some cars. In the 2004 fuel economy guide released by the US EPA and DOE, the Toyota RAV4 had the highest fuel economy in the SUV category, getting 24 mpg, whereas the best of the large cars, the Chevrolet Malibu, got only 22 mpg. The 2004 vehicle with the worst gas mileage was a car—the Lamborghini L-147, which got only 9 mpg. What??? Is Grinning Planet giving a free pass to purchasers of 6,000-pound gas-guzzling behemoths and other SUVs? No way. Most purchasers of such vehicles don't actually NEED them, and putting status, ego, or macho-ness—or, even worse, exploitation of a tax loophole—above reduction of pollution and imported oil use does indeed deserve scorn. But even if the front part of the Line of People Whose Vehicles and Driving Habits Need Improving is predominantly SUV drivers, all of us can ask ourselves [picture of pristine mountain lake]
whether we can do more to reduce gasoline usage and pollution by purchasing a more environmentally friendly vehicle or developing greener driving habits. And now, for the REAL villains in this debate; those old stand-bys we all love to jab at: Congress and the White House. And we don't just mean the current Congress and White House. For the last dozen years, our elected leaders, in concert with our never-admit-anything-can-be-improved auto manufacturers, have squashed attempts to significantly raise fuel economy standards. This is particularly irksome when it comes to SUVs, since they are driven like cars but are not held to the same gas-mileage standards as cars. We payers-at-the-pump and breathers-of-the-air should be outraged that fuel economy standards have not risen significantly for both SUVs AND cars. It's shameful that the average vehicle today gets worse gas mileage than the average vehicle in 1980. The argument that SUVs and minivans will be unaffordable or unmanufacturable if they are made more fuel efficient is the same sort of gloom-and-doom scaremongering that manufacturers put forth in the 1970s when fuel-economy and pollution standards were first proposed. Car makers CAN apply such measures to SUVs and minivans, and they should. The Union of Concerned Scientists recently designed two SUVs that were safer and more fuel efficient than today's models—without sacrificing size or performance. (See the UCS report here)
Whether you're an anti-SUV crusader who calls them "F-U Vs" or you're an SUV owner who drives one with pride, we should be able to agree that keeping reasonable style and performance choices in the vehicle fleet and making all vehicles safer, more fuel-efficient, and less polluting are both worthwhile and compatible goals. Publish date: 11-DEC-2003
BRAIN FOOD It is worth noting that although the Toyota RAV4 has slightly better gasoline costs and lower carbon dioxide emissions than the Chevrolet Malibu, it gets worse ratings for emissions of carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, and hydrocarbons.   You can get Grinning Planet free via email each week

  High and Mighty: SUVs—The World's Most Dangerous Vehicles and How They Got That Way
by Keith Bradsher (Non-Fiction)   DESCRIPTION Just what is it that some people hate so much about SUVs? For Keith Bradsher, it's a number of things; but let's start with their gas-guzzling obesity, their higher pollution levels, and their poor safety ratings on the road. Bradsher is also critical of the devious way Detroit has marketed SUVs and slipped them past many of the regulations that apply to "the rest of us," and he's non-too-happy about how our politicians and regulators have let it happen. But this book is not just a rant—it uses facts to make the case. You'll have to read it for yourself to decide whether SUVs really are the world's most dangerous vehicles.

  PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENT   Hey, we don't pick the Google ads!   – GP     "Even though cars get worse gas mileage than two decades ago, they actually have become much more efficient. The problem is that the efficiency went into more power and larger, heavier vehicles, not into fuel economy. If all of the technological efficiency improvements had gone into efficiency, miles per gallon would be significantly higher than they are today." — Neal Elliott, American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy

Motorcycles Remain Most Dangerous Vehicles NHTSA Announces Discretionary Cooperative Agreements For Research Under The Crash Injury Research And Engineering Network (CIREN) HRSA To Update State-By-State Self Assessments Of Trauma Care Systems CMS Announces Improved Efforts To Reduce Medicare Payment Error Rates
Motorcycles Remain Most Dangerous Vehicles
While travel by motor vehicle has become steadily safer in the United States, motorcycles remain the most dangerous type of motor vehicle to drive. Motorcyclists are involved in fatal crashes at a rate of 35.0 per 100 million miles of travel compared with a rate of 1.7 per 100 million miles of travel in cars. This study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) examined the association between alcohol impairment and fatal motorcycle crashes. Over the time period 1983 to 2003, the rate of fatal motorcycle crashes among alcohol-impaired drivers declined for drivers under 40 and rose for drivers over 40. The rate of fatal motorcycle crashes among alcohol-impaired drivers was highest among 20-24 year-olds in 1983 and among 40-44 year-olds in 2003. Because older drivers involved in fatal motorcycle crashes are more likely to be alcohol-impaired than younger drivers, future efforts to reduce alcohol-impaired driving among motorcyclists should include older drivers. Additional key findings include: The percentage of fatally injured motorcycle drivers who were alcohol-impaired declined from 1983 to 2003 in all age groups except the 55-59 years old age group. In 1983, 8.2% of the fatally injured motorcycle drivers with elevated blood alcohol concentrations (BAC) were aged 40 or older; by 2003, 48.2% of such drivers were in this age group. Motorcycle drivers in fatal crashes aged 40 and older were more likely to be alcohol impaired than car drivers aged 40 and older. Overall motorcycle mortality rates per 100,000 people declined from 1.6 in 1983 to 0.9 in 1993 and then rose to 1.2 in 2003. Rates for age groups under age 30 declined over this time period, whereas rates for age groups over 40 increased. Proven Community Strategies to Prevent Alcohol-Impaired Driving Include: Sobriety checkpoints 0.08% blood alcohol concentration laws Minimum legal drinking age laws Zero tolerance laws for young or inexperienced drivers School-based approaches to reduce riding with drinking drivers Management-supported intervention training programs for alcohol servers Mass media campaigns that are carefully planned and well executed, that attain sufficient audience exposure, and that are implemented in conjunction with other ongoing prevention activities

NHTSA Announces Discretionary Cooperative Agreements For Research Under The Crash Injury Research And Engineering Network (CIREN) The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) December 8 (69 FR 71101-71118) announced discretionary Cooperative Agreement opportunities to provide funding to Level One Trauma Centers in support of the Crash Injury Research and Engineering Network (CIREN). NHTSA anticipates funding these Cooperative Agreements in annual installments for one base year plus 4 one-year option years at NHTSA's option and subject to available funding. Due to budgetary constraints and the levels of effort applicants may propose, NHTSA is uncertain as to the number of Cooperative Agreements that will be funded. However, multiple awards will be made under this announcement. These cooperative agreements will support projects to improve the prevention, treatment, and rehabilitation of motor vehicle crash injuries to reduce deaths, disabilities and human and economic costs.
DATES: Applications must be submitted to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, Office of Contracts and Procurement (NPO-220), Attention: Dianne Proctor, 400 Seventh Street, SW., Room 5301, Washington, DC 20590. All applications submitted must include a reference to NHTSA Cooperative Agreement Program Number DTNH22-05-H-01001. Only complete packages received on or before 2 p.m. e.s.t. on February 8, 2005, will be considered for award. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: General administrative and programmatic questions may be directed to Dianne Proctor, Office of Contracts and Procurement, by e-mail at Diane.Proctor@nhtsa.dot.gov
or by phone at (202) 366-9562 and Karin E. Eddy, Office of Contracts and Procurement, by e-mail at Karin.Eddy@nhtsa.dot.gov
or by phone at (202) 366-9568. To allow for sufficient time to address questions appropriately, all questions must be submitted in writing no later 2 p.m. e.s.t., December 20, 2004, via e-mail to Karin.Eddy@nhtsa.dot.gov. Response to the questions will be posted on http://www-nrd.nhtsa.dot.gov/departments/nrd50/ciren/CIREN.html
by January 10, 2005 and in the Federal Register. The objective of the Cooperative Agreements is to fund CIREN Centers to add to the scope of data and expertise available and to increase CIREN's benefits to the public. NHTSA intends to award up to ten (10) Cooperative Agreements (depending on available funding at the time of award and the levels of effort proposed by the applicants) to support the goals of this initiative. Each Cooperative Agreement recipient will be expected to identify and coordinate an effort that supports the goals outlined in CIREN System Requirements. Subject to the availability of funds, it is anticipated that NHTSA will award up to ten (10) Cooperative Agreements to support the goals of this initiative for a period of five (5) years (i.e., one base year and four one-year Option Years, if exercised). Each Grantee will be expected to coordinate an effort that supports the goals outlined in the CIREN System Requirements. NHTSA anticipates that approximately three million dollars ($3,000,000.00) in total federal funding will be available for award of up to ten (10) Cooperative Agreements under this Federal Register Notice for the base year. Funding for each of the four (4) option years for each of the Grantees will be based on the availability of funds in future fiscal years. HRSA To Update State-By-State Self Assessments Of Trauma Care Systems The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) December 13 (69 FR 72204) to collect data from the 56 States and Territories on their current trauma care systems to assess progress since the initial survey in fiscal year 2002. This information will be used to establish a national strategy to assist in future grant opportunities to the States to improve or enhance their basic systems infrastructure in trauma care delivery, as well as their collection and usage of quality trauma data. HRSA will be collaborating with partners from within HRSA's Healthcare Systems Bureau, Division of Healthcare Preparedness (DHP), Bioterrorism Hospital Preparedness Program; HRSA's Office of Rural Health Policy; and HRSA's Maternal and Child Health Bureau. In addition, HRSA will collaborate with the Office of Public Health Emergency Preparedness; the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality; the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Center for Injury Prevention and Control; the National Highway Traffic and Safety Administration's Emergency Medical Services (EMS) Division; and affiliated professional organizations through the DHP Trauma Program's National Trauma-EMS Stakeholder Group. HRSA has included national performance measures for Trauma/EMS for this project in accordance with the requirements of the "Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) of 1993" (Public Law 103-62). This Act requires the establishment of measurable goals for Federal programs that can be reported as part of the budgetary process, thus linking funding decisions with performance. CMS Announces Improved Efforts To Reduce Medicare Payment Error Rates The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) December 13 announced new steps to measure error rates in Medicare payments more accurately and comprehensively at the contractor level, and to further reduce improper payments through targeted error improvement initiatives. "We have made significant strides in how we measure the error rate in Medicare payments, and that will enable us to do even more to bring it down,” said CMS Administrator Mark B. McClellan, M.D., Ph.D. “We have much better data that will help us pinpoint problems and allow us to work with the Medicare contractors and providers to make sure claims are submitted and paid properly." In addition, independent auditors for CMS issued an unqualified opinion on the agency’s fiscal year 2004 financial statements, which are required by the Government Management Reform Act. This year’s opinion marks the sixth consecutive year that CMS has received an unqualified opinion, demonstrating CMS’ stewardship, discipline and accountability in the implementation of its fiscal responsibilities Under the new measurement process for the Medicare error rate, the net national rate for fiscal year 2004 was 9.3 percent. The enhanced information comes from the first full year of data for an expanded program run by CMS to collect more detailed and contractor-specific information to help prevent future errors. CMS also announced new initiatives to reduce the error rate by more than half to 4 percent in four years, by building on recent reforms in payment oversight and new authorities in the Medicare law. Medicare pays more than 1 billion claims each year. In fiscal year 2004, CMS reviewed approximately 160,000 Medicare claims from the preceding year to learn, more precisely, where errors were being made. This review was the most extensive ever, providing CMS with more accurate information about contractor-specific error rates, error rates by provider type, and error rates by service type. This level of detail and accuracy is critical for CMS to identify where problems exist and target improvement efforts more effectively, and it reflects the agency’s increased commitment to use more detailed data and analysis to identify and eliminate improper payments. “We have developed the best data ever on contractor specific error rates,” said Dr. McClellan. “With this new and detailed information, we are now able to develop specific steps for the Medicare contractors to take more effective actions in reducing the error rates. Using this report and the new, comprehensive data, we can better manage our contractors, making them more accountable to the taxpayers, beneficiaries, and providers, and laying a foundation for the further contractor reforms that we intend to implement in the next few years.” The 2003 analysis identified a large and unexpected increase in the rate of non-responses. CMS adjusted the non-response rate based on past experience with non-responders and other error categories, reporting the 2003 adjusted error rate as 5.8 percent. Without adjusting for the non-response, the 2003 payment error rate would have been 9.8 percent. The 2004 data for error rate analysis was larger and more detailed than the 2003 data, just as the 2003 data was more extensive than data from previous years. Since 1996, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has annually determined the error rate for fee-for-service (FFS) claims paid by Medicare contractors, the insurance organizations that process and pay Medicare claims. From 1996 until 2002, the HHS Office of Inspector General (OIG) using a sample size of about 6,000 claims conducted the process used to measure Medicare payment error rates. The measured error rate declined from 13.8 percent in 1996 to 6.3 percent in 2002. In fiscal year 2003, and as part of the agency’s enhanced efforts to improve payment accuracy, CMS began calculating the Medicare FFS error rate and estimate of improper claim payments using a methodology approved by the OIG for the past two years. Since 2003, the OIG has assisted CMS in developing, reviewing, and formulating further actions based on the more extensive data collection. "The assistance provided by the Office of Inspector General is helping us improve our accuracy and effectiveness in identifying and responding to problems in paying claims,” said Dr. McClellan. “The majority of providers are honest and want to make sure they file their claims correctly so they can be paid timely, and we’re taking new steps to work with our contractors to make sure that happens, as we move forward with fundamental contractor reform over the next few years.” CMS’ more extensive survey, involving a more comprehensive analysis of a larger number and variety of claims, was accompanied by well-coordinated outreach to health care providers to improve claims submissions. CMS established two programs to monitor the accuracy of Medicare FFS payments: The Comprehensive Error Rate Testing (CERT) program and the Hospital Payment Monitoring Program (HPMP). The main objective of the CERT program and HPMP is to measure the degree to which CMS and its contractors are meeting the goal of “Paying it Right.” The 2004 analysis does not adjust the non-response rate, and also includes other data improvements that reflect input from Congress and other oversight partners. In particular, the sample of claims for fiscal intermediaries, who process and pay Medicare Part A claims, was doubled from the prior year so that intermediary-specific error rates could be calculated at the same levels as the Medicare carriers (Part B contractors) and durable medical equipment regional carriers. The data now permits accounting for appeals involving all types of benefits (not just hospital benefits). Thus, the more comprehensive error rates of the last 2 years are illustrative of CMS’ new measurement process. Of the total payments sampled in 2004, results of the new measurement program indicate the following payment error traits: 4.1 percent of payments had errors due to insufficient documentation being submitted (2.6 percent was reported in the 2003 analysis, which included much less information on fiscal intermediaries in 2003); 2.8 percent had errors due to non-responses to request for medical records (an unadjusted 5.0 percent rate was found in 2003); 1.6 percent had errors due to medically unnecessary services (1.3 percent in 2003); 0.7 percent had errors due to incorrect coding (0.7 percent in 2003); and the remaining 0.1 percent had other errors (0.2 percent in 2003). The claims included in this analysis were submitted before many of the agency’s recently-implemented initiatives to reduce error rates took effect. The more comprehensive data provides CMS with the opportunity to enhance and expand its efforts to monitor the impact of these initiatives. As part of its general efforts to further reduce the Medicare error rate, the CMS contractors will be required to: Develop corrective action plans that include efforts to educate providers about the importance of submitting thorough and complete medical records; Identify where additional review of claims and education on submitting claims is needed, based on information that shows where the highest percentage of errors on overused billing codes are occurring; and Use the performance results to develop local efforts to lower their error rates by addressing the cause of the errors and outlining corrective steps. "We've taken major steps in recent years to get much better data on payment accuracy for each and every one of our contractors, and in every case, better measures mean an ability to reduce error rate for those contractors,” said Dr. McClellan. “We've taken a major step this year to improve data on the fiscal intermediaries, and we are now using this information to drive down their error rates in the same way." In addition, CMS is continually developing educational material and information for healthcare providers as part as of "The Medicare Learning Network.” CMS has developed over 250 national provider education articles annually that outline, on a flow basis and in plain language, the coverage, billing and coding rules associated with Medicare program changes.

Wall Street Journal, 2/9/93: "The Most Dangerous Vehicle on the Road" by Walter Olson
  "The Most Dangerous Vehicle On the Road" By Walter Olson Wall Street Journal, February 9, 1993 Jury interviews suggest that last month's $ 105 million verdict in Moseley v. General Motors was based in part on anger at GM's unrepentance: Despite lawsuits and press reports fingering its 1973-87 trucks as unsafe, the company has refused to concede they are flawed at all. Soon after the verdict GM continued its defiance by counterattacking, charging that crash tests done for an NBC expose' in November were rigged by attaching incendiary devices to the trucks. Serious though these charges might seem, some have already dismissed them as GM damage control. Are the trucks, in fact, unsafe? Try to identify from this list the GM truck that Clarence Ditlow, director of the Center for Auto Safety, told NBC was a "rolling firebomb" and that NBC, summing up his charges, described as the "most dangerous vehicle out there on the road." Fatal Crash Rate (per 10,000 registered vehicle years) (National Highway Traffic Safety Administration)
A 1.162 B 1.446 C 1.514 D 1.652 E 1.824 F 2.212 G 2.347 H 2.455 The correct answer is C, the GM full-size vehicle in the Moseley case. (Seventeen-year old Shannon Moseley died in the fire after his GM truck was hit by a drunken driver.) Of the entries on the list with worse records, D represents passenger cars as a general average; E, F, G, and H, light pickup trucks from various makers (Ford, Nissan, Toyota, Chrysler). Of course, one must approach numbers of this sort with caution: For example, models bought by younger and more aggressive drivers may show higher crash rates through no fault of their design. Still, anyone who imagines the GM truck (1.514) an unconscionable death trap would also be wise to avoid the large majority of other vehicles on the road (1.652 to 2.455). Many analysts cry foul at comparing full-size pickups to smaller vehicles, since bigger is known to be safer as a general rule. In the litigation context, that's a strange cavil: If auto makers may freely offer small trucks to the public, why punish them for offering a large truck with a much better safety rating? But in any case, consider B, the full-size Ford entry, which was in fact the market's closest competitor to the GM model. (A, Dodge's full-size entry, did not score a hit with consumers, whatever its safety virtues.) Ford's very thin edge over the GM model may or may not represent anything more than statistical noise, driver bias, and so forth. Anyone who chooses to live in a wood rather than a brick house accepts a far wider adverse safety differential. One policy, of course, would be to punish any firm that fell behind in safety competition, as determined years later in statistical retrospect. That would ensure litigators a steady supply of provender, much as if, out on the veld, they were entitled to munch on whichever gazelles were at the rear of the pack. (The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety has acknowledged, by the way, that the current safety scare is unlikely to add materially to the premiums that GM truck owners pay; the accidents in question are far too rare.) When trial lawyers took their case to the general public through the media, they stressed intuition rather than statistics. It seems that GM, alone among auto makers, had gone about hanging gas tanks on the side of its trucks like dartboards, outside the protective frame rail. The tanks "were placed in about as stupid a place as they can possibly be placed," one of the plaintiff's lawyers informed "NBC Dateline." In a "side impact or a sideswipe impact, " plaintiff s expert Byron Bloch explained to a rapt NBC reporter, "the fuel tank gets crushed ... There is an immediate holocaust." So the overall numbers didn't matter. GM's design choice had invited specific, avoidable deaths, and the company must be punished. As it turns out, neither NBC nor most other news outlets bothered to report that the GM trucks have actually scored better over the years in avoiding fatal crashes when it comes to side-impact collisions, their presumed weak point. Specifically, the full-size GM trucks did slightly better (.196 fatal side-impact crashes per 10,000 registered vehicle years) than the comparable Fords (.200) and almost as well as the Dodges (.190), though the three are bunched so closely together that the numbers hardly matter. How on earth could these trucks have done better in side crashes, given that GM itself chose to move the tanks inboard in a 1988 redesign? Maybe the numbers are a fluke. Or maybe it's that the trade-offs in car safety are not well understood even by experts. Any possible placement of the fuel tank "causes" some accidents and averts others. Respectable designers have tried every gas-tank location at one time or another: front (as in old Volkswagen Beetles), rear (the Ford Pinto and many others), inside the passenger compartment (older trucks), or underneath (now usual, despite the hazards of flying gravel, sparks, ground-slams, and broken axles). All have been rejected at other times as unsafe. Maybe the distinctive narrow frame of GM trucks--popular with customers, but damned by the plaintiff's lawyers because it required the gas tanks to be placed outboard--offers some sort of obscure advantage in side crashes. It's hard to know. We do know that although you are apparently no more likely to have a fatal side-impact crash in your GM truck, if you do have one it is somewhat more likely to involve a fire. To that extent, intuition--but not the trial lawyers' case--is vindicated. We also know that in GM trucks, as in all other kinds, you are much more likely to die in a front-end than in a side crash, and vastly more likely to die in a crash without a fire than in one with. When fire is present in a fatal crash, it's often in the sort of high-force collisions that would have been lethal in any case--though the jury viewed the Moseley case as an exception. And--hardly a surprise given the statistics--it turns out that GM gas tanks are not exactly as fragile or exposed as DDT eggshells, as viewers might have concluded from watching the NBC video or trial lawyer's summations. The tanks not only complied with but far exceeded the U.S. government's safety standards, which specifically address the danger of gas-tank breakage in side crashes. (Fully obeying this kind of law, it turns out, will not keep you from getting sued.) In fact it takes about 4,000 side-impact crashes in a GM pickup to get one fire with a major injury or fatality, which means the supposed "rolling fire-bombs" may compare favorably with haystacks or mounds of feathers as objects to crash into. The more data we see on the safety record of existing cars, the more dubious the safety scares of the past begin to look. The Audi 5000 affair, in which one of the safest cars on the road was wrongly accused of "sudden acceleration," is only the best known of a whole series of lawsuit-driven campaigns that have collapsed in disgrace and refutation. Remarkably, even the affair of the "exploding" Ford Pinto--universally hailed as the acme of product liability success--is starting to look like hype. In a summer 1991 Rutgers Law Review article Gary Schwartz demolishes "the myth of the Pinto case." Actual deaths in Pinto fires have come in at a known 27, not the expected thousand or more. More startling, Schwartz shows that everyone's received ideas about the fabled "smoking gun" memo are false.  The actual memo did not pertain to Pintos, or even Ford products, but to American cars in general; it dealt with rollovers, not rear-end collisions; it did not contemplate the matter of tort liability at all, let alone accept it as cheaper than a design change; it assigned a value to human life because federal regulators, for whose eyes it was meant, themselves employed that concept in their deliberations; and the value it used was one that they, the regulators, had set forth in documents. In retrospect, Schwartz writes, the Pinto's safety record appears to have been very typical of its time and class. Ford, like GM, lost a $ 100 million verdict, although not much of that survived appeal. The scandal of punitive damages is that they're handed down with none of the due-process protections we'd accord targets charged with genuine criminal wrongdoing: strong screening of unreliable evidence, proof beyond a reasonable doubt, prosecution by independent professionals rather than interested parties, and so forth. Until we furnish such protection, punitive damages--as in the Moseley case--will threaten to make a travesty of justice. **** Walter Olson, senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, is the author of The Litigation Explosion.

  The most dangerous squad in Baghdad
By P. Mitchell Prothero
United Press International
Baghdad, Iraq, Jul. 7 (UPI) -- "How'd you end up with us, is this an embed?" the ridiculously young looking soldier asked me as we crouched on the roof of a power transformer station, surveying downtown Baghdad. He's peering down the sight of his belt-fed machine gun at a group of Iraqis located about 500 meters (yards) away towards the Tigris River when he realizes that they're armed. "Shit, shit, they have weapons," he yells across the roof at his corporal. "So fucking kill them," comes the pithy reply from the other ridiculously young solider. "Wait, wait. They're ICDC or ING or whatever the fuck they're called now," yells another. "They're with us." In the last week the Iraqi Civil Defense Corps has been renamed the Iraqi National Guard, a distinction that only means that the Iraqis will not be killed by the four man team that's protecting this impromptu command post. The roof is hot. Baghdad's high temperature on Wednesday is 118 degrees and the men of squad two, second platoon of the 1st Cavalry Division's 1-9 Regiment have already lost three men to the heat and it's only about half past noon. When told that I had just happened to hook up with their unit after being caught in the middle of a running gun battle in central Baghdad, one of the men laughs. "Well asshole, you just hooked up with the most dangerous squad in Baghdad," he says without looking up from his weapon, which is now trained on a small group of men several blocks away who are certainly not ING. Just what might be ordinary bravado from a young soldier echoes across the cement rooftop, his squad-mate clarifies. "No really we are," he says. "Out of the 11 of us, only two haven't won the Purple Heart in the last four months. It sucks to be us." He means that to be in his unit offers a nine out of 11 chance to be wounded in action. Having been quiet for the past 10 days as Iraq saw its sovereignty returned, insurgents picked the morning that the interim Prime Minister Iyad Allawi announced sweeping security measures that effectively allow him to declare martial law to stamp out Iraq's bloody insurgency to attack U.S. and ING forces in central Baghdad. Terror attacks are common in Baghdad. Insurgents attacking convoys and U.S. bases outside Baghdad are frequent. But masked gunmen running through central Baghdad in fire fights with police, ING and U.S. military is unheard of. It barely happened during the invasion of Iraq. The morning began with a mortar attack on Allawi's residence, which we couldn't get close enough to investigate. Then suddenly traffic became even worse than its typically insufferable level. And the sight of U.S. Apache attack helicopters sweeping on firing runs in downtown Baghdad indicated something major was happening. Having deftly avoided much of the traffic, my driver and I were looking for what was happening, expecting a cordon of military vehicles keeping us away from the action. What we didn't expect was that our deftness -- a result of my driver's surreal ability to avoid traffic jams -- would drive ourselves into the middle of a firefight. As bullets flew around our car, which was hastily abandoned, we ran for the shelter of a nearby hospital. We could see U.S. troops far down the broad boulevard. And there was a lot of firing, but we couldn't see who was shooting or at what. But we could hear the bullets smacking trees nearby the now abandoned car and U.S. troops at the end of the road weren't shooting or getting shot at, making the usual calculations of how to safely cover a firefight -- avoid the people getting shot at -- useless. Having decided that the car was a safer option than huddling and waiting to figure out who was doing the shooting, we broke for the car and headed for the nearest Iraqi Police station to find out what was going on. The police station was milling with police carrying assault rifles and some casually mentioned that they were currently under attack from unknown forces. But the shooting had just stopped, likely connected to the missiles fired from an Apache overhead and the black smoke pluming into the sky a few blocks away. Just as the Iraqis were trying to decide whether they were still under attack, three Bradley Fighting Vehicles of the 1st Cav. arrived and dumped three squads of infantry into the area. As they took up defensive positions, they uncharacteristically ignored me, probably due to gunfire directed on their positions. It wasn't well aimed and hit no one in the vicinity, but it caused the platoon leader to send out a squad to stop it. Walking the streets of Haifa -- the neighborhood -- was tense and full of intermittent gunfire, causing the squad to take a solid 30 minutes to travel just a handful of blocks. Having picked the power station as a base, it was checked and gunners assigned to the roof to protect both the station itself and provide supporting fire to a group of ING reportedly a few blocks away. They were pinned down by insurgents and had three wounded men. So several armored vehicles arrived with the rest of the platoon and a rescue mission planned in the small courtyard of the building. It was decided that the rescue operation -- headed to the building four blocks away -- would be done on foot. As the 1st Lieutenant commanding the platoon conferred over maps and with his company commander by radio, a hulking sergeant major addressed the men. "We are expecting resistance, this is full weapons on, men," he bellowed. "If you don't like it, soldier, then shoot it. Shoot boxes or anything you think might be an (improvised explosive device). They are expecting us." Setting out in long lines of men covering each side of the street, the soldiers faced not only the odd gunshot, threat of ambush, or, worse, a roadside bomb, but also the stares of Iraqis who were gathering outside their homes and shops to watch the deadly show. Some scowled, others waved, and the men of second platoon were not happy walking through a rough neighborhood of Baghdad in daylight with little armored vehicle support. And the Apaches had run out of fuel and retuned home so there was no air cover. But as they moved down a side alley along, little happened. Leaving the alley, they broke into the open and quickly established a defensive perimeter around the ING building. One squad ran for the entrance, as the others provided cover, only to find the building locked. "Open this door or I'll open it myself," one soldier yelled at a confused Iraqi man outside the building who clearly had no idea what he was talking about. The ING, it turns out, had already left, even remembering to lock up the facility. "I hate this shit," said the lieutenant. "We have terrible (communications) with the ICDC or ING, or whatever they are. I can't believe this." But even as the group withdraws, one soldier sees something a block away. And a report of men using a nearby house to stage attacks has just come through. Three doors are hit. The first two have only women and children. The third small building has 12 fighting age men in it. And all of their identification is suspicious enough that -- despite the absence of weapons -- it's decided to arrest them for questioning. So second platoon marches their 12 prisoners -- and a growing band of curious reporters -- back the vehicles. As they are loaded into armored vehicles for the ride back to the unit's forward operating base, one of the men manages to slip away and actually sits down at a café down the block pretending like he wasn't involved. A translator for one news organization notices and the reporter innocently asks one soldier why the man was let go. "Get that guy," cries the lieutenant, who then walks over to the café himself and grabs the man, who doesn't even try and deny anything. He just shrugs and follows his friends into the back of the vehicle. Moments later, rifle shots ring out as one soldier notices that the street down the block is now littered with cardboard boxes. He carefully puts a round through each one to make sure none holds a roadside bomb. "You can't be too careful in Baghdad," he shrugs. [UPI Perspectives]

Name: Email: Crime is defined by the Merriam-Webster dictionary as
an act or the commission of an act that is forbidden or the omission of a duty that is commanded by a public law and that makes the offender liable to punishment by that law.   Laws are designed to protect us and ensure our safety in all aspects of our lives: physical, financial, psychological and social.  Yet not a day does go by that we don’t hear of crimes taking place in our city or state.  When a crime is committed, public safety becomes endangered and specific individuals or groups may feel violated.  While we would like to avoid such events, they take place all too often.  Here are some statistics that demonstrate this:
Every two
minutes, somewhere in America, someone is sexually assaulted.
In 2002, there were a total of 4,854 cases of aggravated assault in
Washington DC.  On a daily basis, this computes to 13.2 aggravated assaults a day.
In Maryland, there were 3,228 cases of larceny and thefts per 100,000 people in 2002.  This is one-third higher than the national average rate of 2,445.8 cases per 100,000.
In Detroit, there were 41.79 murders per 100,000 people in 2002.  This is alarmingly way above the national average rate of 5.6 for the same year.
In 2002, with the exception of burglaries, Philadelphia
led all crime levels which were above the national average rates for murder, forcible rape, robbery, aggravated assaults, larceny/theft and motor vehicle theft.

In addition to crimes against individuals,   
Corporate crime
has recently jolted the corporate world with the likes of the
Enron
scandal and the
Martha Stewart
arrest.  Across
America, worker rights are often violated by threats of firing and other reprisals made to those who dare to exercise their lawful right to collective bargaining and unions.   In 2000, when a department of meat cutters at a Wal-Mart center in
Texas
voted 7-3 in favor of unionization, Wal-Mart eliminated the meat cutting department, choosing instead to pre-cut meats, resulting in the elimination of meat cutting jobs nationwide.  The garment and fabric factories
of
New York
are filled with immigrant workers, many of whom do not have proper working documents. Many of these workers end up enduring poor working conditions for fear of deportation and
INS
investigations, encouraged by the factory owners.  Through collective bargaining, unions protect the rights of workers by giving them fair representation in the work place.  On the contrary, some union leaders have been charged for their involvement in crime activities (racketeering, fraud and tax evasion, embezzlement, and extortion).  Union or not, corporate crime exists on both ends of the continuum, where the workers continue to be victimized and their rights violated.   
Another major type of crime is terrorism.  The tragic events of 9/11 and the terrorists that brought on those acts of destruction have changed the lives of Americans forever.  Support the
fight against terrorism.  
The War on Drugs
deals with addressing the violation of drug laws.  Tremendous resources have been devoted and spent on this war, locally and internationally.  The recent extradition
of drug criminal Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela to the
US
is a sign that indeed the
US
is continuing to wage a war against drug crime.
Social and Economic Problems Caused by Crime
Our social and economic problems are often a direct result of crime.  In a vicious circle, these problems can fuel crime even more.  For example, those who commit theft and burglaries often do so because of their need for money.  These individuals may be unemployed, incapable of finding work, homeless, sick or impoverished.  These crimes become a tempting way to quickly acquire money.  Unfortunately, when left unpunished, these individuals get the misconception that crime pays.  It is this thinking that encourages some individuals to continue their criminal ways, discouraging them from finding other activities that would give them some normality and stability in their lives.  This way of thinking reinforces crime.
Another crime, prostitution, is frequently associated with drug addiction.  Many prostitutes find it difficult to change their work because of their drug addiction.  Drugs require significant cash and prostitution provides this, faster and easier than legitimate work.  Prostitution often will lead to other crimes such as
people trafficking,
sexual abuse, and rape.  Those who exploit women often have no regard for people’s lives.  This disregard often leads to physical abuse and even murder.  In addition, prostitution can increase the spread of diseases such as AIDS, other
STD’s and hepatitis. 
On a larger scale, drug addiction fuels the illicit drug industry.  Through our web site War on Drugs, you can learn more about the social and economic problems that drugs cause.  In organized crime, you will find other violations related to drug trafficking.  These include money laundering, smuggling and illegal sale of weapons, credit card fraud and counterfeiting.  Poverty often leads to the problem of homelessness.  Those who live on the streets often experience hunger and disease making them more likely to resort to committing theft and burglary as a means to eat or to obtain medicine.  Out on the streets the homeless
are exposed more to the risks of drug addiction and other unwanted social behaviors.  All of these factors fuel crime.
Solving the Root Causes of Crime
In order to eradicate crime, we need to address the root causes.  These include, but are not limited to, greed, inadequate corporate oversight, poverty, lack of education, homelessness, drug addiction, racial hatred, and lax gun laws.  Education is one of the biggest factors that plays a role in what becomes of an individual in their adulthood.  Those who have an education possess the training and skills needed to make them marketable to potential employers.  Indeed, even for jobs that pay only a minimum wage, employers likely will prefer interviewing candidates with a decent education over those without.  Thus, many of the uneducated may find themselves unemployed, living in sub-standard housing and in impoverished conditions.  And as money becomes scarce, many of them might be tempted to engage in criminal activities.  At Grassroots.org, we encourage everyone to pursue formal education and stress the importance of governments and universities helping make it accessible to all.  We strongly believe that every American citizen deserves an education and it’s especially important to make it more available to those families who are not able to readily afford it. Education can help eradicate poverty, which will in turn reduce the crime rate.
Poverty often pushes children to drop out of school.  Those children who do not attend school may end up roaming the streets, exposing themselves to criminal elements and activities.  This is why it is imperative that communities provide safe places where children can gather inside, away from street life.  These include school clubs, youth clubs, and sports and recreational centers where children and youth are given support and supervision through educational and developmental programs.  Without alternatives to schools, children can easily get involved in petty crimes such as shoplifting, residential break-ins, car theft and vandalism.  After the petty crimes, these children may graduate into the more serious crimes of drug trafficking, sexual offences and gang violence.
Crime can also be related to the probability of being caught and the extent of possible sentencing.  On our web site Sexual Abuse, we present information showing that most rapes and most acts of sexual abuse are committed by individuals with whom the victims are related or otherwise acquainted.  Such relationships can discourage victims from reporting incidents to law enforcement agencies, thus failing to bring the culprits to justice.  Part of the underreporting problem is the social stigma that is attached to these victims.  Although they are victims, they are often blamed for the crime, labelled as being promiscuous and loose.  This allows the real offenders to get away unpunished, leaving them free to offend again.  As citizens, we need to adopt laws and reporting procedures that will give full physical and psychological protection to victims who report crime.  Let us not allow offenders to get away with their crimes, giving them an opportunity to repeat.
Corporate crime is becoming increasingly global and its consequences can be devastating.  Consumers are defrauded.  Our environment (soil, air and water) is often compromised.  Our personal safety can be placed at risk by lobbyists who buy influence but do not have the interest of the greater majority at heart.  A case in point is the
Federal Ban on Assault Weapons.  The National Rifle Association, a powerful lobbyist organization that opposes the federal ban, including background checks at gun shows, has been a very large donor of money to political parties since 1989.  Although the federal ban and background checks help to ensure our safety, these two issues remain unresolved today.  Visit our web site
Lobbyists
for a more thorough discussion on influence buying.  Scandals such as the Enron accounting fraud have resulted in job loss, pension loss, investment loss, a negative impact on the confidence of the American public on the corporate system, loss of taxes due to the Treasury and more.  Today, as reported by
Citizen Works, there are many other corporations today being investigated for irregular accounting practices.  A few examples are K-Mart, Qwest Communications, WorldCom and Xerox.
We must work to curtail corporate greed.  The practice of “influence buying” needs to be stopped.  Corporations must have tighter controls over their accounting reporting procedures.  We call for greater transparency as well so that irregularities in accounting practices can be detected early to mitigate any damages.  The practice of corporate disclosure needs to be widened.  This will allow consumers and shareholders to become fully aware of corporate records on the environment, human rights, worker safety and financial matters.  It will also allow us to know about corporate criminal records and litigation records.  Multiple functions within consulting firms need to be severed and made independent from each other to prevent conflicts of interest.  The Arthur Andersen firm was caught in such a conflict in the Enron scandal, as the firm served both as the accountants and consultants for Enron.  Arthur Andersen was later found guilty of obstruction of justice.  The company was essentially shut down by that and other accounting scandals.
Our prison rehabilitation and prison systems need reform.  A
report
published by the Urban Institute confirms that although the number of parolees regularly being released from our prison system is large, the number of them going back into prison is alarming.  In 1980, as many as 27,000 parolee violators returned to prisons. By 2000, this number increased to 203,000.  This amount represents a 652 percent increase.  There are a number of reasons for this:
Continuing social problems drive parolees back to crime. 
The number of parole officers is not enough to handle the demand of case loads. 
Educational and vocational programs for inmates in prisons need improvement.
Prison personnel need more training in prison based inmate rehabilitation.  This will ensure a higher success rate of inmate re-integration in to society.  Many private prisons have high staff turnover, chronic understaffing and inexperienced correctional officers.  These private prisons are focused primarily on profit, with the inmates being secondary concerns.
If those in charge of our prison system give priority first and foremost to the rehabilitation and re-integration of inmates, this in turn will have a positive effect on the reduction of crime.
Calls to Action
As law abiding citizens, it is imperative that we live our lives according to the rules of our land.  It is also our civic duty to report any crimes that we witness.  The reasons are simple: our laws are meant to preserve the quiet and peaceful enjoyment of living in this great country of the
United States.  Anytime a law is broken, it can compromise the safety of our citizens.  What makes our nation so great is the freedom given to us by our forefathers: our freedom of speech, of religion, of protest, to vote, to get an education, to go to work, to information and many more!  These freedoms are valuable and precious to all of us.  These freedoms are the reasons why the
UShas waged several battles on crime including the War on Drugs and the War on Terrorism. 
Although the costs of these battles are plenty, the rewards are worth it.   9/11 has changed our lives forever, no doubt.  Today, there are Americans who still live in fear of when and where the next terrorist attacks will happen.  Immediately after the strikes on the
World
Trade
Center, such fear was overwhelming and widespread.  There is great debate on whether the
US
is winning the war in
Iraq.  Many question whether our soldiers should even be there.  However, there is no question that 9/11 has not repeated itself in
USsoil. There is also no question in our minds that the War on Drugs is having a positive effect given the fall and extradition of many Colombian drug lords.  Grassroots.org is asking you to support our law enforcement agencies.  Give encouragement to those who put their lives on the line to protect our freedoms.  And most importantly, let each of us live according to the laws of our nation.  Democracy is powerful.  Freedom makes the war on crime even more worth it!

Background information
Conference of the Parties
Address by Ambassador Luigi Lauriola, Chairman of the Ad Hoc Committee on The Elaboration of a Convention Against Transnational Organized Crime at The Millenium Assembly of the United Nations General Assembly, New York, November 2000 The Convention represents a major step forward in the fight against transnational organized crime and signifies the recognition of UN Member States that this is a serious and growing problem that can only be solved through close international cooperation. The Convention, concluded at the 10th session of the Ad Hoc Committee established by the General Assembly to deal with this problem, is a legally binding instrument committing States that ratify it to taking a series of measures against transnational organized crime. These include the creation of domestic criminal offences to combat the problem, and the adoption of new, sweeping frameworks for mutual legal assistance, extradition, law-enforcement cooperation and technical assistance and training. States Parties will be able to rely on one another in investigating, prosecuting and punishing crimes committed by organized criminal groups where either the crimes or the groups who commit them have some element of transnational involvement. This should make it much more difficult for offenders and organized criminal groups to take advantage of gaps in national law, jurisdictional problems or a lack of accurate information about the full scope of their activities. The Convention deals with the fight against organized crime in general and some of the major activities in whichï¿½transnational organized crime is commonly involved, such as money laundering, corruption and the obstruction of investigations or prosecutions. To supplement the Convention, two Protocols also tackle specific areas of transnational organized crime that are of particular concern to UN Member States. The Protocol against the Smuggling of Migrants deals with the growing problem of organized criminal groups who smuggle migrants, often at high risk to the migrants and at great profit for the offenders. The Protocol against Trafficking in Persons deals with the problem of modern slavery, in which the desire of people to seek a better life is taken advantage of by organized criminal groups. Migrants are often confined or coerced into exploitive or oppressive forms of employment, often in the sex trade or in dangerous occupations, with the illicit incomes generated from these activities going to organized crime. The Protocols also commit countries which ratify them to making the basic subject of the Protocol a criminal offence and to adopting other specific measures, such as controls on travel documents, to combat the problem. These supplement the more general measures found in the Convention, and countries must become parties to the Convention itself before they can become parties to any of the Protocols. A third Protocol, dealing with the illicit manufacturing of and trafficking in firearms, parts and components, and ammunition, remains under discussion. The texts of these documents were developed over 11 sessions of the Ad Hoc Committee, and footnoted texts may be found under each session. The Convention was finalized at the 10th session, and the complete text forms part of the Report of that session. The Protocols dealing with the smuggling of migrants and trafficking in persons were finalized at the 11th session and are reported there. These three instruments were adopted by the UN Millenium General Assembly on 15 November 2000, and final texts are included in the Report of that session. Instruments Finalized instruments: United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime and following protocols: Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children, supplementing the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime Protocol against the Smuggling of Migrants by Land, Air and Sea, supplementing the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime (PDF) English,

Organized Crime
This compilation of resources focuses on adult gangs, gangsters, the mafia, and international gangs. For more information about youth gangs, look under Gangs. "Transnational organized crime will be one of the major problems facing policy makers in the 21st century. It will be a defining issue of the 21st century as the Cold War was for the 20th century and Colonialism was for the 19th. No area of international affairs will remain untouched as political and economic systems and the social fabric of many countries will deteriorate under the increasing financial power of international organized crime groups." -Louise Shelley, Director of TraCCC.

http://www.nagia.org/Crips_and_Bloods.htm
Surprisingly, little has been written about the historical significance of black gangs in Los Angeles (LA). Literature and firsthand interviews with Los Angeles residents seem to point to three significant periods relevant to the development of the contemporary black gangs. The first period, which followed WWII and significant black migrations from the South, is when the first major black clubs formed. After the Watts rebellion of 1965, the second period gave way to the civil rights period of Los Angeles where blacks, including those who where former club members who became politically active for the remainder of the 1960s. By the early 1970s black street gangs began to reemerge. By 1972, the Crips were firmly established and the Bloods were beginning to organize. This period saw the rise of LA’s newest gangs, which continued to grow during the 1970s, and later formed in several other cities throughout the United States by the 1990s. While black gangs do not make up the largest or most active gang population in Los Angeles today, their influence on street gang culture nationally has been profound. Article by Alejandro A. Alonso.

http://www.nagia.org/Hybrid_Gangs.htm
As the "gangsta" culture continues to spread throughout North America, the influence of California and Chicago gangs are now being felt in both large metropolitan areas and with increasing frequency in small, rural communities. The lesson has been well-learned that the problem of street gangs is one that touches all ethnic and socio-economic classes. However, as law enforcement agencies have attempted to deal with the gang problem in their respective communities, some very significant differences have been discovered from the historic perception of these gangs, and their behaviors in areas outside of Chicago or Los Angeles.

http://usinfo.state.gov/regional/ea/chinaaliens/polishprof.htm
Paper delivered by Professor Emil W. Plywaczewski, Ph.D., at the 3rd Annual Symposium "Crime and Its Control in Greater China", June 21-22, 2002, University of Hong Kong, PRC. Summary: Chinese organized crime has become well established in every major Chinese community across the world, Plywaczewski says. Members include community leaders as well as ordinary workers. "It is difficult to penetrate this subculture," Plywaczewski writes, "because members have no prior criminal records.... They can conceal their criminal activities through their involvement in lawful business activities." Plywaczewski provides detailed information on Chinese people-smuggling operations in Austria, Hungary, Poland and other European countries. He notes that Chinese criminal groups operate in isolated "cells," each with a specific duty and unaware of other cells in the criminal operation except the one from which it accepts assignments. In the case of people smuggling, some organizations will, for a higher fee, provide their "customers" with "a guarantee of effectiveness." That is, the smugglers guarantee that they will get their client to a target country no matter how many times they might be stopped by law enforcement.

http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/nij/international/chinese.html
The organizational structure of Chinese organized crime in the United States is quite complex. Broadly defined, there is a great variety of Chinese criminal organizations. These include gangs, secret societies, triads, tongs, Taiwanese organized crime groups, and strictly US-based tongs and gangs. According to Ko-lin Chin, the foremost academic expert in the U.S. on Chinese organized crime, there is no empirical support for the belief that there is a well-organized, monolithic, hierarchical criminal cartel called the "Chinese Mafia." Chin says: "My findings...do not support the notion that a chain of command exists among these various crime groups or that they coordinate with one another routinely in international crimes such as heroin trafficking, money laundering, and the smuggling of aliens" (1996:123).

http://www.fbi.gov/hq/cid/orgcrime/ocshome.htm
Organized crime, in the U.S. and around the world, is a critical concern of the law enforcement community. The cooperation among these organized criminal enterprises in recent years has allowed them to greatly increase the scope and magnitude of their illicit activities. Our world has seen widespread and unprecedented political, economic, social, and technological changes in the last two decades. Organized criminal enterprises have been quick to take advantage of the opportunities created by these changes to satisfy their greed and lust for power. The cost to communities and individuals, in terms of pain and suffering caused by the violence and exploitation associated with these organizations, is incalculable. Also the damage to society resulting from these criminal organizations and their influence on labor unions, political institutions, financial markets, and major industries is immeasurable. In fact, a look at the economic impact alone gives a glimpse of the importance of this issue. The Center for Strategic and International Studies, Global Organized Crime Project, Financial Crimes Task Force estimates global organized crime reaps profits of close to $1 trillion per year. The FBI's fight against organized crime is unlike other criminal programs. Instead of focusing on these crimes as individual events, the FBI's Organized Crime Program targets the entire organization responsible for a variety of criminal activities. The FBI has found that even if key individuals in an organization are removed, the depth and financial strength of the organization often allows the enterprise to continue.

The rapid spread of international crime since the end of the Cold War is unprecedented in scale, facilitated by globalization and technological advances, and poses a significant challenge to the United States and democratic governments and free market economies around the world. The President has identified international crime as a direct and immediate threat to the national security of the United States. To meet this challenge, the Departments of Justice, State, and Treasury--working closely with numerous federal agencies--jointly developed a comprehensive national strategy to fight international crime and reduce its impact on Americans. The International Crime Control Strategy, which was released in May 1998, provides a dynamic action plan that serves as a roadmap for a coordinated, effective, long-term attack on international crime.

Global organized crime activities are elusive because many global orgainzed crime groups operate through a variety of high tech means, which are difficult to trace. The groups operations have global implications such as illegal biological, nuclear, and chemical weapons trade.

La Cosa Nostra or LCN -- also known as the Mafia, the mob, the outfit, the office -- is a collection of Italian-American organized crime “families” that has been operating in the United States since the 1920s. For nearly three quarters of a century, beginning during the time of Prohibition and extending into the 1990s, the LCN was clearly the most prominent criminal organization in the U.S. Indeed, it was synonymous with organized crime. In recent years, the LCN has been severely crippled by law enforcement, and over the past decade has been challenged in a number of its criminal markets by other organized crime groups. Nevertheless, with respect to those criteria that best define the harm capacity of criminal organizations, it is still pre-eminent. The LCN has greater capacity to gain monopoly control over criminal markets, to use or threaten violence to maintain that control, and to corrupt law enforcement and the political system than does any of its competitors. As one eminent scholar has also pointed out, “no other criminal organization [in the United States] has controlled labor unions, organized employer cartels, operated as a rationalizing force in major industries, and functioned as a bridge between the upperworld and the underworld” (Jacobs, 1999:128). It is this capacity that distinguishes the LCN from all other criminal organizations in the U.S. James O. Finckenauer, Ph.D., National Institute of Justice.

http://www.rcmp.ca/ccaps/media_e.htm
The Canadian public is exposed to extensive media coverage of events related to organized crime (OC). Every day, an impressive array of stories appear in both print and broadcast media. A study carried out last year estimated at more than 27,000 the number of articles that referred to organized crime in 15 Canadian dailies and magazines over a six-year period (Beare & Ronderos, 2001). This massive exposure is significant, as the media are among the sources of information people count on to mould their opinion of the world around them. And with respect to crime, surveys have shown that up to 95% of people say they rely on the media as their primary source of information in this regard (Graber, 1979). Given the extensive OC media coverage here in Canada and its role as a possible source of public information in this regard, it seems imperative that we answer the following question: Does media coverage of OC-related events influence public opinion, and, if so, how?

http://www.rcmp.ca/ccaps/media_coverage_e.htm
Police managers feel that the media tend to focus too much on organized crime activities that involve violence. Because of this emphasis on violence and sensationalism, the media often underplay organized crime activities with no apparent violence. The activities downplayed the most by the media, in terms of impact, are money laundering and economic crimes. Police managers also stated that the media give too much exposure to positive or socially acceptable events linked to organized crime. They consider, however, that police operations, trials and political interventions related to organized crime receive adequate and relatively proper coverage. Police managers are concerned about a lack of in-depth articles, editorials and feature stories that could provide an in-depth look at issues related organized crime. According to some managers, the biggest shortcoming is that the media never provide a comprehensive view of the actual causes and overall impact of organized crime in Canada.

http://www.sgc.gc.ca/publications/policing/1998orgcrim_e.asp
Over the past few years in Canada and around the world the topic of organized crime (OC) has attracted increased concern and attention. With this concern has come the need to better understand the phenomenon in its entirety. While many OC studies have been produced that describe or examine a particular OC activity or OC group, relatively little attention has been focused in any systematic way on the impact of OC on Canada, Canadians and their communities. The Organized Crime Impact Study (OCIS) addresses this issue. It does so not by focusing on OC groups but rather on the impact of key activities, such as the illicit drug trade, that organized criminals participate in and help sustain. Highlights from a study by Samuel Porteous for the Solicitor General Canada. The first attempt to measure the impact of organized crime on Canada.

This chapter inquires into the mafia phenomenon in Russia to evaluate its potential for threatening the success of economic reform. The first section considers the term mafia in popular parlance and in the economic literature. The second section looks at the conditions historically associated with the development of mafias. The third section addresses the underground economy in the latter years of the Soviet Union as the framework from which the current Russian mafia, the subject of the fourth section, developed. The claim that Russia's problems with crime are merely an early stage of capitalism is addressed in the fifth section. A final section considers public policy approaches. Annelise Anderson.

There are fifty ways of saying "to steal" in Russian, and the Russian mafia uses them all. It is the world's largest, busiest and possibly meanest collection of organized hoods, consisting of 5,000 gangs and 3 million people who work for or with them. Its reach extends into all fifteen of the former Soviet republics, across eleven time zones and one- sixth of the earth's land mass. It intrudes into every field of Western concern: the nascent free market, privatization, disarmament, military conversion, foreign humanitarian relief and financial aid, even state reserves of currency and gold.

Hackers have launched computer viruses and disruptive denial-of-service attacks, but the biggest danger comes from hackers with ties to organized crime breaking into computers, FBI officials said. Spearheading the organized hacking rings is the Russian Mafia, security experts say.

Location and call number
Russian organized crime constitutes a direct threat to the national security interests of the United States by fostering instability in a nuclear-armed power. Left unchecked, Russia is in jeopardy of becoming a criminal syndicalist state under the control of corrupt government bureaucrats, politicians, quasi-businessmen, and criminals. Composed of senior-level U.S. government representatives and private-sector experts, the task force assesses the breadth and depth of Russian organized crime and corruption, addresses current U.S. policy, and makes recommendations on how best to confront these challenges.

An article by Lydia S. Rosner, John Jay College. This article deals with the perceptions inherent in that phenomenon called the Russian Mafia. It examines a theoretical problem which lies at the juncture of criminology, sociology of knowledge, and cultural or cross-cultural studies, and asks whether significances other than those apparent on the surface govern perceptions as they concern organized crime and immigrant illegality. It describes the fascination of the American press with all newly-emerging criminal enterprises and asks several functionalist questions concerning the possible ramifications of this interest.

Behind the pleasing facade of Asian restaurants, bakeries, herbal medicine drug stores, fresh produce markets and gift shops pandering to neighborhood residents and out-of-towners, street gang investigators in the past few years, have been tracking a major heroin trafficking rings involving the importation of multiple kilos of heroin brought into the neighborhood for resale on the street.

Improvements in transportation, computer and communications technology have made the world today much smaller than it was 50 years ago. Intercontinental travel which used to require days or weeks now takes place in hours. The formerly daunting notion of conversing or conducting business with someone halfway around the globe is now a mouse-click or a telephone call away. This globalization has created a world virtually devoid of national borders. Unfortunately, these changes have also made it easier for members of highly sophisticated and organized criminal syndicates to pursue a complex web of lucrative legal and illegal activities worldwide.

A report by the United Kingdom National Criminal Intelligence Service on organized crime. (Last checked 06/15/04) United Kingdom Threat Assessment, 2001, Second Edition
http://www.ncis.co.uk/threat_assessment.html
This report gives a picture of serious criminal activity with organized crime groups (OCGs) involved in a diverse range of crime sectors, with the aim 'first and foremost to make money'. As well as traditional high-profile crimes such as drug-trafficking, robberty, extortion, theft and fraud, there is increasing concern over intellectual property theft (IPT) -- both in its own right and contributing to other criminality. The report draws attention to the sheer scale and complexity of counterfeiting -- especially of consumer goods - whether they are manufctured in the UK or in the cheap labor markets of the Far East. While UK Conterfeiting is often perceived as an activity by low level criminals, counterfeiting is, in fact, highly profitalbe and has a hevy involvement by organized criminals in the 'production, buying, importing and distribution of all types of counterefeited products'. The other misperception is that counterfeiting does not merit priority attention by law enforcement agencies but the report highlights that "the profits from IPT can help OCGs to become more established and to fund other various criminal activities'.

Hearing on Russian Organized Crime - 4/30/96 1996 Congressional Hearings Intelligence and Security

Contents:
{Background}
The International Crime Problem
International Training
Interagency Working Group
Legal Attache Program
Grave crime is no longer bound by the constraints of borders. Such offenses as terrorism, nuclear smuggling, organized crime, computer crime, and drug trafficking can spill over from other countries into the United States. Regardless of origin, these and other overseas crimes impact directly on our citizens and our economy. We have developed a variety of anti-crime efforts both here and abroad to combat these dangerous threats. This effort has been undertaken with the support of the President, Attorney General Janet Reno, and Secretary Warren Christopher. One of the most effective ways to fight international crime is by building cop-to-cop bridges between American law enforcement and our overseas counterparts. Without these relationships, there cannot be the commonality of purpose and open communication required for success. More and more of these bridges are being built, and successes are flowing from them. We are using a number of approaches to develop cooperative law enforcement programs with other countries. For example, our Legal Attache Program works closely with a large number of foreign police forces. Not only do they cooperate on specific cases, but our Legal Attaches -- who are highly-skilled senior FBI Agents -- also form a sort of distant early warning system to alert us to new and emerging crime threats. Another very powerful tool is training: the FBI places a high priority on assisting our foreign law enforcement counterparts through training courses here and abroad. And just a year ago, we took a major cooperative step with other Federal agencies and other foreign nations with the creation of the International Law Enforcement Academy in Budapest. These and other programs combine to help give the FBI the critical foundation needed to effectively combat international crime. There is also another vital factor: I want to thank this Committee for its crucial recognition of the importance of these issues and for your support in meeting the crime challenges from abroad. This is a rare opportunity to extend the Rule of Law while mobilizing law enforcement to meet the explosion of international crime against America. I am exceedingly grateful for the support Congress has given us and pledge to continue to work with Congress as we develop a stronger global network of effective law enforcement. Your support of law enforcement training at the Department of State has been critical to the success of our programs. The International Crime Problem
The political, social, and economic changes occurring in Eastern Europe and in the former Soviet Republics have provided significant, unintended opportunities for organized crime groups and criminal enterprises in these countries to expand internationally. Evidence that organized crime activity from these areas is expanding and will continue to expand to the United States is well-documented. These criminal enterprises are not a new phenomenon to Russia. They existed under Communism. Appropriate legal tools were not created to control organized crime and corruption activities. When Communism declined in the Soviet Union, the organized crime groups quickly expanded their influence in the emerging move toward Capitalism, again because sufficient constraints and law enforcement tools were not present. The FBI has many years of successful investigative and prosecutorial experience in the battle with La Cosa Nostra and other organized crime groups here in the United States. We view organized crime as a continuing criminal conspiracy having a firm organizational structure, a conspiracy fed by fear and corruption. This definition can also be applied to the organized crime threat facing Russia and many other countries. Members of a typical Russian organized crime group are found at every level of society. Organized crime activity in Russia includes monetary speculation, manipulation of the banking system, and embezzlement of state property, as well as contract murder, extortion, drug trafficking, prostitution, protection rackets, and infiltration of legitimate business activity. To make matters worse, a number of Russian/Eurasian organized crime groups and criminal enterprises presently operate in the U.S. Many of these criminal enterprises active in the U.S. have demonstrated a willingness to work in close concert with other non-Russian/non-Eurasian organized crime groups. The United States and Russia fully realize the need for joint cooperation against crimes that harm both countries -- and other parts of the world as well. That is the reason the FBI has opened a Legal Attache Office in Moscow to work closely with Russian police against a variety of costly crimes. From July 1994 to the present, the number of cases worked by the FBI Agents in Moscow has increased from 20 to over 200. If Congress agrees, and with the cooperation of the Department of State and the Department of Justice, we hope to expand our network of Legal Attache Offices around the world. The global needs are great -- and many nations, including Russia, are working diligently to fight crime that hurts the law-abiding everywhere. One of the specific issues of great concern to the FBI and to Russian authorities is the theft and diversion of nuclear materials -- and the potential theft of nuclear weapons by terrorists or rogue nations. Over the past year, legitimate concerns have been raised by the apparent vulnerability of radioactive materials to theft or diversion in several areas of Eastern Europe and Eurasia. The seizure of significant amounts of cesium in Lithuania and the seizure of uranium in the Czech Republic are examples of the concerns in the international community regarding the threat of nuclear proliferation. The recent increases in radiological-nuclear material incidents throughout the world have caused the international law enforcement community to communicate better with each other. Although there have been no seizures of nuclear material in the United States, two recent cases involved conspiracies to import radioactive material into this country. In New York, the U.S. Customs Service arrested foreign nationals attempting to negotiate the sale of radioactive zirconium metal into the U.S. Ultimately, 45 tons of the material were seized in Cyprus, enroute to the U.S. In the other case, the Canadian Customs Service intercepted radioactive isotopes originating in Russia being smuggled into the U.S. through Canada. The FBI assisted the Canadian law enforcement agencies in their investigation. While some crime problems flow from East to West, others flow back from West to East. One of the most difficult law enforcement problems facing many of the newly-freed and Eastern European nations is drug trafficking. The scourge of drug trafficking has had a devastating impact on the entire global community. Russia, the Newly Independent States and Eastern Europe are certainly not immune to this epidemic. Criminal organizations in these emerging democracies are taking advantage of the relaxed borders and improved telecommunications systems that have emerged in recent years to facilitate their illegitimate operations. These countries are targets of opportunity for the major drug trafficking organizations, like the Colombian cartels, which seek to establish new and lucrative markets. International Training
The FBI's international approach in combating Russian and other international organized crime groups includes general and specialized law enforcement training for foreign law enforcement agencies. During Fiscal Year (FY) 1995, the FBI trained 4,400 foreign law enforcement personnel. This training is particularly critical with respect to the police agencies of some of the newly-emerging democracies. Most of this training is accomplished by funding generously made available by Congress to the Department of State through the Freedom Support Act (FSA) and Support for Eastern European Democracies (SEED) funding. The FBI and the Department of State, working together, are also responsible for the International Law Enforcement Training Academy in Budapest, which functions as the center for law enforcement training for officers from many Eastern European, Russian and Eurasian nations. The Academy at Budapest provides an eight-week professional development program similar to our FBI National Academy Program at Quantico. During FY 1995, a total of three classes graduated from the Budapest Academy -- each of 33 mid- level police officers. Those officers came from the Czech Republic, Hungary, Latvia, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Estonia, and Lithuania. For FY 1996, the schedule is much more aggressive, calling for approximately 200 persons to be trained from the following countries: Albania, Belarus, Bulgaria, Croatia, Estonia, Hungary, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Latvia, Macedonia, Moldova, Poland, Russia, Slovenia, and Ukraine. We can be immensely proud of the Academy at Budapest. It is a direct outgrowth of our trip to Eastern Europe in 1994 and President Clinton's direction to U.S. Government agencies to join together to build the world's capabilities in fighting international crime. The Academy represents the combined efforts of the Department of State (DOS), the Department of Justice (DOJ), the FBI, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), the United States Secret Service (USSS), the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center (FLETC), the Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms (ATF), and other agencies and countries. It is truly a case where all of these law enforcement agencies are working together as partners toward a common goal. I cannot speak highly enough about the contributions ATF, DEA, Secret Service, IRS and the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center in the Department of Treasury have made in making the Academy succeed. The Academy brings together seasoned investigators as instructors and law enforcement officers from across Eastern Europe, Russia, and the Newly Independent States to learn policing under the Rule of Law. I am especially grateful to our host country, Hungary. Just last week, I along with my other counterparts from the United States were honored to attend the dedication of the International Law Enforcement Academy. With the recent completion of renovations, the capacity of the Academy has been expanded. The dedication was an historic moment in international law enforcement. The FBI also is involved in foreign police training in many other valuable ways. For example, in FY 1995, the FBI performed a total of 10 In-Country Training Needs Assessments. It works this way: at the invitation of the host government, we analyze that country's police training needs and capabilities. We then make a recommendation of how we believe we can best assist the host country's law enforcement capabilities through specifically targeted training. The assessments were conducted in Albania, Belarus, Bulgaria, Estonia, India, Kazakhstan, Kyrgystan, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova, Paraguay, Peru, Poland, Romania, Tunisia, Ukraine, and Uruguay. Through the FBI's In-Country Training Program, the FBI conducts one and two-week schools in foreign nations which concentrate on police operations and technical skills. We use seasoned, senior FBI street Agent instructors who use their extensive practical experience in training our foreign counterparts in policing under the Rule of Law. The instructors in these programs have an established expertise in criminal investigations, especially organized crime and white collar crime. Their credibility is not only essential for effective instruction but also is very effective in building the cop-to-cop bridges that we so critically need. Since the first of the year, we have trained 212 officers of the Ministry of Interior for the Russian Federation (MVD) in seminars held in Russia and at the FBI Academy in Quantico. Along with the instruction geared to the investigation of crimes, we have provided training in ethics and internal police controls -- the first time that this has ever been done and an area which is critical to the success of policing under the Rule of Law. Our In-Country Training Programs are primarily funded through the FSA and SEED funds we receive from the Department of State. The FBI, along with other law enforcement agencies, submit proposed international training plans to the Department of State at the beginning of the Fiscal Year. Depending on the funding that is available for law enforcement training, the Department of State then determines the funding amounts for each agency. During the past two years, the FBI has received $8.3 million of these funds for our training initiative. We have been very pleased with the support we have received from the Department of State -- all the training we have proposed has been funded. In addition, the FBI has used $300,000 of its appropriated funding to provide limited training to law enforcement in other countries. In FY 1995, the FBI provided FSA and SEED supported training seminars to over 1,800 law enforcement officers from Hungary, Poland, Slovakia, Czech Republic, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Ukraine, Russia, Romania, and Moldova. In FY 1996, we will expand our training into Belarus, Slovenia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgystan, Bulgaria, and Albania. The training provided is tailored to meet the needs of the participants. Topics addressed include bank robbery, drug trafficking, kidnapping, financial crimes, white-collar crime, organized crime and terrorism. Just recently, for example, we conducted a white-collar crime and corruption seminar in Kazakhstan. All of this training has a direct impact on United States persons and corporations who have flocked to these countries in search of business opportunities. In addition to the training funded by the FSA and SEED Acts, the FBI trained an additional 2,600 students through our other programs. These programs included the crime-specific investigative seminars, targeted crime scene analysis training as provided by our forensic experts, and management training for mid-level and executive law enforcement officers. Last year, 110 international officers also participated in the FBI National Academy program at Quantico. Their participation allows an additional "bridge" to be built from our state and local officers to those overseas. One beneficial part of this training is the opportunity it provides the trainers and the trainees to interact about specific crime problems being encountered in their countries, how to address the problem, share experiences learned in the process and forge new relationships for future cooperation on matters of mutual interest and concern. In some of our investigations, the FBI has benefitted by bringing actual case investigators to the U.S. from other nations to work side by side with FBI Agents. This is a continuation of the training we have provided and allows "hands-on" application and observation of investigative techniques successfully employed by the FBI in our organized crime investigations. As examples of the successes the FBI has seen from contacts and liaison established as a result of this training, a Central European working group on international organized crime and a six-nation working group on international organized crime were established this past year. In addition to the FBI, they bring together law enforcement agencies from Eastern and Western Europe and Canada to discuss specific organized crime threats common to all countries represented. Lines of communication and working relationships are now established and practical law enforcement approaches to the organized crime problems of the regions are planned. As a direct result of this initiative, several countries were, for the first time, able to establish continuing liaison communications with other represented organizations on a direct professional level and to initiate joint investigations. For example, a multi-national, case-specific fraud seminar was conducted by the FBI's Financial Crimes Section from February 18-22, 1996, in Berlin, Germany. The program dealt with bank failures and brought together investigators from the United States, Latvia, Netherlands, Russia, and Germany for a practical case training initiative. The resulting product of these constructive meetings is an investigative organized crime task force, international in scope, that is targeting significant criminal organizations determined to be a major threat to many nations, including the United States. The FBI also presented a nuclear non-proliferation conference at the FBI complex at Quantico, Virginia from April 18-21, 1995, and twenty-eight (28) SEED and FSA nations sent representatives, including, among others, Russia and Ukraine. The conference outlined the problems of nuclear materials and weapons proliferation from the countries of the former Soviet Union and counter-proliferation proposals and training initiatives. The conference is included as a FSA initiative to address this serious problem. The Department of Defense and the FBI are currently in the final stages of submitting the DOD/FBI Counterproliferation Program report to Congress regarding plans to provide international training seminars on nuclear smuggling. This is part of our Nunn-Lugar funded international training seminars program on nuclear smuggling. The FBI's Nuclear Biological Chemical Proliferation Unit is presently in possession of a report compiled by an FBI team that recently conducted a training assessment in the Czech Republic. During this assessment, which was coordinated by our Legal Attache in Vienna, the FBI representatives from the International Coordination Unit, the FBI Laboratory and the Engineering Section, met with various Czech law enforcement agencies, Czech nuclear safety officials, and faculty members of the Rez Institute. This assessment yielded valuable information regarding the concerns and needs of the attending Czech officials. It is proposed that the information provided by the Czechs, with regard to their specific requirements, will result in establishing a training prototype for other countries requesting support in counterproliferation matters. Interagency Working Group
As this Committee is fully aware, the Congress established the Interagency Working Group (IWG) to make recommendations as to training and other support received by Russia, the Newly Independent States, and other Eastern European countries. This has been a successful endeavor that greatly assists us in the proper coordination of our training efforts abroad. The IWG allows all Federal law enforcement agencies to participate in Department of State FSA and SEED funded training initiatives within the former Soviet Union and Bloc nations, based on their respective law enforcement jurisdiction. Participation in the IWG prevents duplication and waste of resources. IWG priorities are formulated by the Departments of State, Justice and the Treasury, as dictated by the various law enforcement entities from those departments, participating on the IWG. The FBI participates as a member of the IWG in carrying out the programs under the auspices of the FSA and SEED. Let me describe the FBI's role: The FBI, as the agency with the broadest Federal law enforcement responsibility, conducted a major portion of the training and technical assistance during FY 1995, with a similar schedule planned for FY 1996. The FBI has exclusive training in the area of organized crime. Other participating agencies like the Drug Enforcement Administration and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms, likewise have exclusive areas of training based on their expertise and jurisdiction. In other areas, such as economic crimes, training by the United States Secret Service, U.S. Customs Service, FINCEN, and DEA compliments that done by the FBI. Legal Attache Program
The FBI's Legal Attache Program is the single most significant factor in the Bureau's ability to detect, deter, and investigate international crimes in which the United States or our citizens are the victims. By stationing Agents abroad and establishing operational links with foreign police, the FBI substantially expands the nation's perimeter of law enforcement protection. Generously funded out of the Commerce, State, and Justice Bill, the FBI's Legal Attaches are truly our first line of defense. International crime has grown enormously in recent years. Technological advances and the end of the Cold War prompted dramatic increases in global travel and telecommunications. Criminals have used these changes to their advantage, diffusing their operations around the world to avoid law enforcement scrutiny. The relentless globalization of crime threatens America both at home and abroad -- and all other law-abiding nations as well. For better or for worse, the global village is now a late-20th century reality. Our experience shows that placing FBI Agents at critical posts abroad provides the most reliable, effective and timely means to combat international crime -- and often at the source. It is essential to station highly-skilled agents in other countries to prevent foreign terrorism and foreign crime from reaching the United States. At present, the FBI has in place in our Legal Attache Offices 70 senior Agents and 54 support personnel in 23 nations around the world, funded out of FBI operational funds. During FY 1995, these offices handled over 11,200 matters. They are the conduit through which law enforcement information and cooperation flows between the United States and its foreign partners. Their goal can be defined succinctly: to keep foreign crime as far from American shores as possible, to keep foreign crime permanently at bay whenever possible, to help combat more effectively those crimes that do reach our borders. The whole point is to protect the American people from harm. FBI Agents stationed overseas are not intelligence officers; they are not a shadow intelligence agency; and they do not engage in espionage. They are law enforcement Agents-- dedicated to fighting organized crime, terrorism, nuclear smuggling, violent crime, drug trafficking, and economic crime. Let me give a few examples of the direct benefits made possible because our agents are overseas and have the cop-to-cop relationships with host authorities critical to effective law enforcement. For over 15 years, FBI Agents in Rome have had a close working relationship with all the major Italian police services. Through one joint investigation which began in 1991, it was determined that members of the Sicilian Mafia, Camorra, and 'Ndrangheta were collaborating with the Colombian drug cartels in shipments of cocaine to Italy and heroin into New York. In that investigation -- which utilized sophisticated investigative techniques, including electronic surveillance -- the FBI worked closely with the Italian police services, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, and Colombian judicial authorities. As a result of our combined efforts, 89 people were arrested in the United States, Italy, Canada, and Colombia. Since their arrests, 30 of these people have been convicted in the United States alone. Kobi Mowatt, a fugitive from the United States, was recently arrested in Tanzania with assistance from our FBI Legal Attaches. Mowatt, an alleged member of the notoriously violent "First and Kennedy Street Crew," from Washington, D.C., is charged with conspiring to participate in a racketeering organization by committing acts of murder, robbery, kidnapping, and drug dealing. He was charged in a 53-count indictment with participating in four homicides, including a triple murder here in Washington in 1994. With direct assistance from our Legal Attaches, and the considerable assistance of foreign police agencies, the FBI was able to track Mowatt through Russia until his capture in Tanzania. Last month, he was brought back to the United States to stand trial. In a major move against a growing Russian organized crime structure in the United States, the FBI last year arrested Vyacheslav Kirillovich Ivankov, allegedly one of the most powerful Russian crime leaders in this country, along with five of his associates on Federal charges of conspiracy to commit extortion. The arrests in New York followed an intensive FBI investigation that was aided greatly by the Russian Ministry of Interior and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and made possible because of our Legal Attaches and the relationships that have flowed from cooperation abroad. The arrest was based upon Federal arrest warrants which charge a total of nine individuals. According to Russian law enforcement authorities, Ivankov formed a substantial criminal organization in Russia before he entered the United States allegedly to manage and control Russian organized crime activities in this country. Russian organized crime groups use businesses in the former Soviet Union, Western and Central Europe, and the United States to serve as fronts for laundering the proceeds of illegal activities and for conducting highly profitable commerce in goods in the successor states of the Soviet Union, known as the Commonwealth of Independent States. In November 1994, several of the defendants allegedly began to extort several million dollars from American and Russian businesses. Intelligence information was shared on a continuing basis among the FBI, the Russian MVD and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. FBI Legat participation was critical. Last August, Eyad Ismail was apprehended abroad and brought back to New York to face an indictment charging him with taking part in the terrorist bombing of the World Trade Center that killed six people and injured over 1,000. As the complaint alleged, Ismail fled the United States the night of the bombing. He was taken into custody after an extensive investigation greatly facilitated by an FBI Legal Attache. Last April, Ramzi Yousef and Abdul Hakim Murad were indicted in New York for a conspiracy and attempt to bomb United States commercial airlines serving air routes in the Far East. The indictment alleges that as part of the conspiracy, Yousef placed a bomb in a foreign airliner that exploded and killed one passenger. Yousef was already facing charges relating to the bombing of the World Trade Center in New York. With critical assistance from FBI Legal Attaches, Yousef was tracked to Pakistan, apprehended, and extradited to the United States to stand trial. Murad was identified and likewise extradited to the United States. Both await trial. Most recently, four Russians were charged in New York for conspiring to defraud 24 Russian companies, including a charity established to aid the victims of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster, of approximately $10.8 million. Many other important cases have been made possible only because the FBI Legal Attaches are able to freely work with our foreign counterparts toward the mutually-shared goal of effective law enforcement under the Rule of Law. The FBI is deeply grateful to Congress for the support and contributions for our Legal Attache Program. A relatively few Agents beyond our borders make a contribution out of proportion to their small numbers and the modest amount of dollars spent. As part of the FY 1996 Appropriations process, our Appropriations Subcommittees have asked us to prepare a plan reflecting our assessment of both the short and long-term Legal Attache expansion needs. We have been working closely with the Departments of Justice and State to provide Congress with a carefully thought-out plan designed to better meet the challenges we face from exploding international crime and terrorism. This plan -- which is under final administrative review -- is a realistic, down-to-earth assessment of the vast changes that have occurred in recent years in the world, especially in Europe with the breakup of the former Soviet Union. I am most grateful to our House and Senate Committees for their leadership. Quite candidly, Congress has taken planning for FBI Legal Attache Offices out of the choppy one-year cycle and prompted us to develop a long-term, comprehensive response to a rapidly changing and worsening international crime situation. Once completed, I am looking forward to discussing the plan with Congress. I am extraordinarily grateful for the support Congress has given these programs. In my view, this represents capitalizing on a rare opportunity to protect our citizens by being both prepared and sufficiently aggressive as crime moves into the global arena. At the same time, I wish to thank the Department of State and Secretary Christopher for supporting the FBI's foreign police training efforts and for their leadership on the IWG. Since my trip to Moscow and Eastern Europe in 1994 we have had an ongoing and productive dialogue about our training initiatives -- indeed, an extraordinary partnership has formed. In addition to Secretary Christopher, Deputy Secretary Strobe Talbott, former Assistant Secretary Richard Holbrooke, Ambassador Robert Gelbard, U.S. Ambassador to Hungary Donald Blinken, and many others -- both here and abroad -- have been instrumental in promoting these programs.

GLOBAL ORGANIZED CRIME AS A THREAT TO NATIONAL SECURITY
Global Organized Crime in the Post-Cold War Era
Since the end of the Cold War and the subsequent refocusing of Intelligence away from the Soviet Union, Global Organized Crime has been recognized as a priority threat to national security. Global Organized Crime has been defined by FBI Director Louis J. Freeh as "a continuing criminal conspiracy having a firm organizational structure, a conspiracy fed by fear and corruption." The international crimes that extend over foreign borders and into the United States include drug trafficking, extortion, money laundering, arms smuggling, bribery, and fraud schemes. In recent years these criminal groups have dramatically increased the scope of their activities by taking advantage of many Post-Cold War opportunities such as the lowering of economic and political barriers; the end of communist regimes and the founding of fragile new democracies; the increase in legitimate international trade; and the advances in technology that facilitate global communication and transport. The Administration, Intelligence and Law Enforcement have reacted to the new organized crime groups, emerging on a global scale after the Cold War, by creating a strong national response. The current system is not "broken." However, the threat itself is growing in terms of its scale and complexity at a such a fast rate that it is important to look at possible ways in which the national response to Global Organized Crime can be improved. In order to understand the significance of improving current policy and national efforts against Global Organized Crime, the changing nature and seriousness of the threat must first be understood. The Changing Threats
Emerging threats vs. Familiar problems
Global Organized Crime in the Post-Cold War Era pose some familiar national security threats and some threats that United States did not previously have to address. The security concerns that existed during the Cold War include: political instability of foreign governments, international drug trafficking and arms transfers to hostile parties. Global criminal leaders present new puzzles within these familiar threats. Former Director of the CIA, R. James Woolsey, described the difficulties of applying traditional national security methods when addressing Global Organized Crime, ...the tools of diplomacy are ineffective and irrelevant in dealing directly with these criminal groups. Even under the most difficult, intractable period of the Cold War, if consensus was not possible, communication was, nevertheless, feasible. Not so in the world of organized crime. Although we do negotiate with our key allies and friends to better attack the problem, there is no negotiating table where we can try to work out a compromise or reach a consensus with criminals.... In addition, certain distinctions can be made between Global Organized Crime and terrorism. While many terrorist groups that engage in violent acts are motivated by specific political causes, such as Egyptian Islamic Fundamentalist terrorists who use violent means to protest their country's current government and Western influences, most organized crime groups are only interested in political power for the security it would provide their organization and are primary motived by money. The international economic threat, posed by Global Organized Crime, in an increasingly global economy is among the major "new" threats to national security. The major economic powers and the less developed nations did not previously share a collective problem of this nature. Global Organized Crime does not just affect a select group of financial institutions or regional areas, it affects international financial networks and economies at a national level. These threats present new conflicts that will require innovative strategies in the future. Global Cooperation among Organized Crime Groups Cooperation among Global Organized Crime groups has increased as restrictions have lessened between international borders. These foreign havens for criminals and their assets have made it increasingly difficult for Law Enforcement to trace illegal profits; gather evidence on the criminal leaders; and identify and contain criminal groups. When Law Enforcement activities in Florida reduced the amount of Colombian cocaine being smuggled into the U.S. through the Carribean islands, the Colombian drug cartel leaders simply began working with their Mexican counterparts instead of their Carribean partners. Another example of an international partnership is Columbian drug lords selling methamphetamine to American dealers in the U.S., the ingredients for which were produced through Colombian connections to organized crime in Europe, Asia and the Far East. These global networks allow organized crime groups to greatly increase the profits of their operations and their methods of evading local governments as they share information, skills, costs, market access and relative strengths. Threat to Global Economy
Transnational organized crime groups pose more of a threat to international financial markets as the world economy becomes increasingly interdependent. Laundering billions of dollars in organized crime money worsens national debt problems because the large sums of money are then lost as tax revenue to that country's government. Russian organized crime groups are actively involved in banking, according to FBI official James Moody, because public financial institutions are "the most vulnerable and lucrative target." The Russian Interior Ministry has estimated that organized crime "controls" most of Russia's 200 banks and half of its financial capital ("control" ranges from ownership and operation to influence over bank decisions through threats of violence). U.S. and Western businesses in Russia, in particular, are frequent targets of extortion, robberies, threats and murder. Security costs for these businesses (especially physical protection, extra protection of cargo, and forced payments to gangsters for "protection,") often consume more than 30% of profits. The fear generated combined with organized crime monopolies in certain industries, such as the agriculture and construction markets in Columbia and Venezuela, damages the overall economy because it discourages legitimate, innovative businesses and entrepreneurs (foreign and domestic) from entering the market. Political Impact
Global Organized Crime can have a damaging effect on political structures, especially the fragile new systems of government found in the former communist or totalitarian regimes. South American drug cartels have a destabilizing effect on governments through their financial support of local guerilla rebels, such as the Sendero Luminoso in Peru and the Revolutionary Armed Forces in Columbia, who share their animosity toward the government and who exchange protection for money and arms supplies. The Sicilian Mafia have used their economic power over local businesses and banks and their supplies of cash to corrupt politicians, judges and Law Enforcement, assassinating many of those public figures who will not cooperate. Media polls indicate that the many Russians believe the "mafiya" is more powerful than the government. As people feel that the government is powerless to stop organized crime, they turn to crime leaders for protection and political institutions begin to deteriorate. Fear of organized crime undermines the credibility of political reform and may encourage support for anti-democratic, hardline politicians such as Russia's Vladimir Zhirinovsky who promised during the 1993 campaign to end organized crime in 3 months through mass arrest and execution. The Potential for a Major Nuclear/Arms Theat The global networks of criminals, terrorists and corrupt government officials and their complex methods of smuggling goods could easily be transferred to the smuggling of nuclear materials on a massive scale. While Global Organized Crime has become increasingly more involved in the transfer of arms, encouraged in part by conflicts in the Balkans and former Soviet Union which proved to be profitable for the Russian and Italian mafia, the smuggling of nuclear materials seems to be currently isolated to select incidents and mostly to amateurs. Russia no longer has the nuclear materials protection that it had during the Cold War when materials were controlled by a tight, centralized system under a politically powerful government. In the past year, the FBI has seized major shipments of nuclear materials in Eastern Europe, including large seizures of cesium in Lithuania and uranium in the Czech Republic. As Global Organized Crime groups become more powerful and as nuclear materials become more vulnerable (through poor management, underpaid desperate workers in the nuclear facilities, and government corruption) the threat becomes more serious. Damage to Society caused by International Drug Trafficking International drug trafficking poses a threat to the social fabric of all countries. The increase in the scale of these operations has led to an increase in drug use, addiction, and general crime level. The common U.S.-Mexico border alone causes a tremendous increase in the American drug problem: 60-70% of cocaine in the U.S. enters at this border through a Mexican-Columbian organized crime partnership. Other European organized crime groups use this border to transport heroin, marijuana, and methamphetamine. It is becoming increasingly difficult to track the flow of narcotics into the United States as the drug cartel methods become more technically sophisticated: redesigning the interiors of Boeing 727s to hold maximum amounts of cocaine; transferring drug profits electronically to dozens of banks around the world in less than 24 hours; and using falsified export documents and invoices for goods in order to disguise drug trafficking transactions. THE CURRENT NATIONAL RESPONSE TO GLOBAL ORGANIZED CRIME
The Administration
President Clinton and the current administration have acknowledged the threat of Global Organized Crime by supporting new anti-crime legislation and by highlighting the issue in public forums. Reducing transnational crime, according to President Clinton, is a part of the challenge of "making sure America remains the strongest force in the world for peace and freedom, security and prosperity" as it enters the 21st century. Presidential Decision Directive-42 (PDD-42), created by President Clinton, recognizes that Global Organized Crime is a threat to national security. The directive orders government agencies to "use creatively and aggressively all legal means to combat international organized crime,"creates the authority to deny visas to a broad range of organized criminals, and sanctions authority against governments that cooperate with or provide sanctuary to organized crime figures. While PDD- 42 brought public attention to the issue of international organized crime, it did not expand or change current policy. President Clinton merely highlighted the topic with PDD-42 and repeated older policy. In comparison, PDD-35 may prove to have a significant effect on the threat because it will affect the amount of Intelligence resources devoted to global crime. PDD- 35, which defines intelligence requirements, declares that intelligence collection and analysis of international criminal and drug activities should be a high priority. The President has also actively supported the International Crime Control Act of 1996 which addresses Global Organized Crime with measures that include expanding the definitions of money laundering, eliminating the statute of limitations for all federal criminal offenses committed outside of the United States and encourages global cooperation among governments through joint-law enforcement programs. The Act will provide U.S. Law Enforcement with a little more flexibility overseas in their investigations and arrests of international criminals. It is possible for the President to lead a government-wide initiative against a new security threat. In the late 1940's, the U.S. developed a strategy for containing Soviet sponsored communism. This unified plan of action included the Marshall Plan, military build-up, development of long-standing alliances (especially NATO), public diplomacy efforts to rebuild foreign democracies and the focusing of the Intelligence Community on the problem. The Post-Cold War Era has a different world context, but the successful strategy can still serve as a model for intergovernmental cooperation. Law Enforcement and Intelligence
Different Perspectives on Global Organized Crime
Containing organized crime traditionally has been the domain of law enforcement agencies while addressing national security concerns has been primarily the field of the Intelligence Community. Transnational crime blurs the line between "domestic" and "foreign" affairs because the criminals have a global impact: they are based in foreign countries, but have international ties, including many in the United States. The Law Enforcement perspective on Global Organized Crime is that it is a major cause in the increasing domestic and international crime levels. Law Enforcement seeks to reduce global crime through arrests and successful prosecutions of the international organized crime leaders. The Intelligence perspective examines global crime in terms of its political and economic impact overseas and as a threat to national security. Intelligence agencies pursue information on Global Organized Crime that will assist Law Enforcement in their investigations but are primarily concerned with providing policy-makers with global crime intelligence. The differing perspectives on Global Organized Crime reveals larger differences between Law Enforcement and Intelligence. Since the Law Enforcement mission is to enforce the law and provide information to court trials that will establish proof beyond a reasonable doubt, they are acutely sensitive to evidentiary requirements when collecting information. Intelligence agencies, because of their mission to provide policy-makers with relevant national security intelligence, collect information for their own analysis and are more concerned with preserving their sources than placing them under the public scrutiny of trials. Generations of Law Enforcement and Intelligence officials working for different missions have resulted in a mutual distrust of working together; while Intelligence worries about protecting its sources and methods when assisting a criminal investigation, Law Enforcement is concerned about protecting their evidence. The Law Enforcement Approach
The Department of Justice seeks to reduce Global Organized Crime by presenting a strong Law Enforcement presence overseas. In recent years, FBI Legal Attache offices alone have grown to 70 Senior Agents in 23 countries. The Legal Attache program works closely with foreign police on specific cases and acts as a "distant early warning system" to alert the FBI of emerging crime threats. Director Freeh has focused on "building cop-to-cop bridges between American law enforcement and our overseas counterparts" and views this as being the most effective means of fighting international crime. The FBI programs in the U.S. and overseas that train foreign law enforcement officers are a central element of this partnership. The model for global cooperation through training is the recent creation of the International Law Enforcement Academy in Budapest. Although the FBI has been successful in building an increasingly extensive network of police force partnerships, the Law Enforcement approach to Global Organized Crime does have its limitations. Director Freeh has suggested that "such international law enforcement problems are not solved by merely an intelligence community response. It is not a matter of spy- counterspy. Instead, it requires a law enforcement response..." Despite Director Freeh's persuasive arguments, there are certain obstacles for a law enforcement response. Collecting evidence beyond a reasonable doubt in Global Organized Crime cases is more difficult because the international networks allow criminals to hide their tracks in different bank accounts, partners, and storage areas around the world. The overall effectiveness of prosecuting these criminals is also questionable in cases when a crime leader is brought to trial, and his organization simply promotes a different criminal to that position in order to continue with its operations. The Intelligence Approach
As part of its new role addressing non-traditional threats of the Post-Cold War Era, Intelligence makes contributions of Global Organized Crime information to Law Enforcement and policy-makers. Former DCI John Deutch redirected the Intelligence Community's resources and activities toward assisting Law Enforcement to "identify, target and apprehend" criminals engaged in illegal trafficking and smuggling. The CIA has reorganized the Director of Central Intelligence's Counter-Narcotics Center into the DCI Crime and Narcotics Center. The new center has tried to provide greater opportunities for law enforcement agencies to gain "actionable intelligence" on specific global crime groups. According to David Carey, Director of the DCI Crime and Narcotics Center, intelligence collection has been primarily directed at the structure of international crime networks and the political and economic impact of the threat. HUMINT (Human-Source Intelligence) has proven to be the most effective Intelligence discipline in collecting information on global crime. In SIRs prepared at the request of the DCI and under the auspices of the National Intelligence Council, HUMINT was graded as being critically more important for narcotics intelligence than all other intelligence disciplines put together. The global networks of organized crime groups interacting with other criminal groups, terrorists and corrupt officials, are not easily observed using the technical methods that were successfully employed for national security concerns during the Cold War. They can, however, be penetrated by human sources. Human agents, through their internal access to the criminal groups, provide information on future dangers and weaknesses of the criminal networks, and without the use of covert action, disrupt and isolate international criminal groups by allowing Intelligence to place them under intense scrutiny. Although the National Security Act of 1947 prohibits the CIA from having domestic Law Enforcement powers, the CIA continues to be involved in Global Organized Crime cases that have domestic elements. Many transnational criminals have connections to American citizens and operate parts of their organization in the United States. For example, over 200 of Russia's estimated 6000 organized crime groups operate with American counterparts in 17 U.S. cities spread out across 14 states. Reagan's Executive Order 12333 clarifies CIA statutory authority in this area by authorizing the CIA to "participate in law enforcement activities to investigate or prevent clandestine intelligence activities by foreign powers or international terrorist or narcotics activity." Cooperation with Law Enforcement allows the CIA to remain active in cases with domestic elements. The CIA, under E.O. 12333, participates in the international aspects of the global crime case and Law Enforcement then handles the domestic aspects that involve U.S. citizens or other areas of domestic involvement. Cooperation Between Intelligence and Law Enforcement Problems in coordinating overseas activities between Intelligence and Law Enforcement have resulted from the greatly increasing number of overseas Justice Department agents (especially FBI), overlapping responsibilities, lack of a clear hierarchy for coordination, different missions and concerns over the risks involved in cases. Law Enforcement agencies alone have problems with inefficient overlap and interference of cases. In April 1992, five Law Enforcement agencies had duplicating analysis of drug smuggling movement by air into Mexico. There is controversy over Law Enforcement coordinating activities with the Ambassador although it is required by law to do so (22 U.S. C. 3927). Law Enforcement expresses interest in keeping the Ambassador informed of its activities but is reluctant to involve him in prosecutorial decisions. On an inconsistent basis, Law Enforcement coordinates the recruitment of confidential informants overseas with the Chief of Station. Although the Chief of Station and Law Enforcement representative are under the authority of the Embassy, there is not a clear hierarchy or set of guide-lines for coordinating activities. Since there is not a single individual or group to organize individual activities, the FBI often acts independently of Intelligence and vice versa. Intelligence and Law Enforcement, from worker to director levels of authority, have created projects to improve coordination between the communities. A special task force is trying to clarify guidelines for cooperation between Intelligence and Law Enforcement overseas. A Joint Intelligence Community-Law Enforcement (JICLE) working group (comprised of lawyers and officials from both sides) was created in 1995 and meets on a weekly basis to help devise solutions to common problems. The recommendations of the JICLE have included Intelligence- Law Enforcement training programs that overcome mission and community culture barriers through education on the laws, regulations, and procedures that facilitate coordination. The new Transnational Threats Committee of the NSC, which includes the DCI and the Attorney General, provides the first formal opportunity for overseas coordination problems to be solved at the highest levels of authority. Global Cooperation
Law Enforcement and Intelligence have found that international cooperation is one of the most effective solutions to transnational problems. The Law Enforcement Community has made significant advances in global cooperation through delegations of American law enforcement leaders visiting foreign counterparts, cooperative criminal investigations, and training programs for foreign Law Enforcement. The Aspin-Brown Commission found that Intelligence derived great benefit from such cooperative arrangements as: exchanging requests for collection; exchanging analysts and technicians; and assisting foreign countries to acquire collection capabilities in order to share the results of future collections. While U.S. Intelligence Community might not want to pursue a thorough "spy-to-spy" method analogous to FBI Director Freeh's "cop-to-cop" approach (due to the inherent risks to sources and methods), the IC still needs to continue global cooperation efforts. In many cases, global cooperation is worth the risk because it provides access to geography, skills, contacts and information that would be otherwise unavailable. ALTERNATIVES TO CURRENT POLICY TOWARD GLOBAL ORGANIZED CRIME
Direction from the Administration
The Aspin-Brown Commission's Preparing for the 21st Century: An Appraisal of U.S. Intelligence recommends that the President by Executive Order reaffirm that global criminal activities are national security matters and require a multi-agency response. The recommendation further suggests that "a law enforcement approach is inadequate." If implemented, this recommendation would have almost zero costs and obstacles but would create little improvement on the present situation by providing no additional funds, manpower or plans for action. The President has already recognized these issues in PDD-35, PDD-42 and through his support for the International Crime Control Act of 1996. The additional Executive Order would not contribute significantly to the reform effort. Legislative Boundaries
The Aspin-Brown Commission recommends an E.O. that would clarify that intelligence agencies with collection capabilities may collect information about non-U.S. persons outside the United States at the request of Law Enforcement. The Commission does not specify if Intelligence would participate based on its own volition and if Law Enforcement could actually task Intelligence. "Tasking," as opposed to "requesting information," would imply a certain amount of Law Enforcement control over Intelligence during the case. The recommendation would basically leave the situation as it is currently but would officially recognize the legality of Intelligence agencies collecting for Law Enforcement. There is a reluctance on the part of the Intelligence Community to accept direct collection requests from law enforcement agencies. NSA and CIA refuse to be directly tasked by Law Enforcement and will only proceed with a collection request on a specific target if they first determine that there is a "foreign intelligence" purpose. This formal requirement is often a mere procedural formality because most requests are determined to be relevant to foreign intelligence. Unfortunately, the requirement can also create tension between the two communities by fostering the perception that Intelligence is unwilling to assist Law Enforcement. Instead of the President creating an E.O., the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal year 1997( IAA97) responded to the Aspin-Brown recommendation with an amendment to the National Security Act of 1947 that clarifies Intelligence assistance to Law Enforcement. Section 105A states "elements of the intelligence community may, upon the request of a United States law enforcement agency, collect information outside the United States about individuals who are not United States persons." The careful wording still implies that Intelligence will participate based on its own volition. If it had been phrased as "Law Enforcement may request that...", it would have had slightly different connotations. As it is currently written, it follows the Aspin-Brown model, and officially authorizes the current Intelligence-Law Enforcement collection procedures without trying to significantly improve them. The amendment, as it was recommended by the Commission, will provide some benefits to Law Enforcement and Intelligence cooperation and will have little costs. The CIA and NSA will benefit by collecting for Law Enforcement with less concern about their legal authorities being questioned. Law Enforcement will benefit from a probable increase in collection requests that are answered. In evading the more controversial question of collection responsibilities and overseas tasking, the Aspin-Brown recommendation and IAA97 also had fewer implementation obstacles. The House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence's IC21: Intelligence Community in the 21st Century recommend that no additional clarifications of the law be made in terms of coordination and cooperation between Law Enforcement and Intelligence. They suggested that there is already enough flexibility and a workable set of legal boundaries in the current laws and standing Executive Orders. E.O. 12333 provides reasonably flexible boundaries for Intelligence assisting Law Enforcement in international criminal cases. Despite these arguments a clarification of the law, as the Aspin-Brown Commission recommended and IAA97 created, still provided some benefits. Lack of precise legal authorities can hamper, delay or side-track cooperation and communication efforts between the two communities. Coordination between Law Enforcement and Intelligence
Global Crime Committee The Aspin-Brown Commission, HPSCI and the Council on Foreign Relations reports agree that the Intelligence and the Law Enforcement Communities need a better mechanism for finding solutions to disagreements and for forming cohesive strategies. The Aspin-Brown Commission recommends that the President create by Executive Order a Global Crime Committee of the National Security Council to direct the U.S. actions against transnational security threats. The committee would be chaired by the National Security Advisor and the core members would include the Director of Central Intelligence, the Attorney General, and the Secretaries of State and Defense. Unfortunately, the Secretary of Treasury is not included among the core members even though his input would be important when the Committee discussed such transnational threats as financial crimes and illegal smuggling. The new committee would identify specific transnational groups that require a coordinated response; establish an overall strategy and monitor its implementation; develop improved procedures for sharing relevant information between the two communities; and develop guidelines to govern the coordination of law enforcement overseas. The recommendation for the creation of this committee is the one of the most significant efforts by the intelligence reform reports to improve the national strategy toward Global Organized Crime. Instead of the President using an Executive Order, Congress responded to the Aspin- Brown Commission's recommendation by creating the Committee on Transnational Threats, under section 804 of the Intelligence Authorization Act of FY 1997. With the exception of the committee's name and a few minor differences, the new Committee follows the model created by the Commission in their recommendation. Unlike the Transnational Threats Committee, previous Intelligence and Law Enforcement working groups, task forces and meetings were not held at a director level, and were not focused on forming a national strategy but rather on resolving individual conflicts between the communities. The Aspin-Brown recommendation succeeded in convincing the Congressional committees to create the Transnational Threat Committee but the real obstacle remains insuring that the directors actually use this opportunity to forge better cooperation instead of a superficial collaboration. The major cost of the committee is pulling already busy leaders away from other activities. The potential benefits of improving the national approach toward global crime will outweigh the costs. The Committee, as it was modeled after the Commission's recommendation, blends all international criminal threats into one label of "global crime" or "transnational threats." While some of the security and diplomacy issues are similar, Global Organized Crime and terrorist groups have different organizational networks, agendas, and weaknesses. They also pose different economic and political threats. While the Transnational Threats Committee will address both of these issues, it should be aware that strategies that are responsive to the differences in Global Organized Crime and terrorism will be more effective in reducing each threat. Single Law Enforcement Representative The Aspin-Brown Commission recommends that the President designate the Attorney General as the focal point and spokesperson for formulating the Law Enforcement strategy for global crime, facilitating cooperation with Intelligence and coordinating overseas Law Enforcement activities. Currently, Law Enforcement responsibility is split between the Attorney General (whose department includes FBI, DEA and INS) and the Secretary of Treasury (whose department includes Secret Service, Customs Service, and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms). The majority of Global Organized Crime issues fall under the Attorney General's responsibilities but Global Organized Crime cases that involve smuggling goods into the U.S., money laundering and other financial crimes, fall under the jurisdiction of the Secretary of Treasury. They should both be included in forming national strategies and in representing Law Enforcement as they direct departments with different responsibilities and resources. The additional Treasury perspective provides more significant benefits than the gain in efficiency that a single representative would provide. The HPSCI report similarly opposes the Attorney General acting as the single representative or the FBI acting as the lead agency of Law Enforcement. HPSCI argues that it would be a mistake to ignore overseas law enforcement agencies outside of the Justice Department. This is an important recommendation because while the FBI has provided innovative solutions to global crime and should continue to be active in influencing the improvement of the overall law enforcement strategy, it is not the only agency involved in overseas activities. Priority in the National Strategy and Coordination
Since effective coordination requires strong leadership, the Aspin-Brown Commission and the Council on Foreign Relations Report suggest that a coordinated national effort against global crime would benefit from Intelligence taking priority over Law Enforcement. According to the Aspin-Brown Commission, in order to coordinate daily activities overseas, Law Enforcement should play a subordinate role under the Ambassador and the Chief of Station. However, HPSCI argues against Intelligence taking immediate priority over Law Enforcement and only recommends that the Chief of Station and the Ambassador be "kept reasonably informed of law enforcement objectives and plans." While Intelligence agencies can make a significant contribution to policy-makers forming decisions on Global Organized Crime, they should not necessarily be given priority over Law Enforcement. The CFR's suggestion that Intelligence be given priority "lest pursuit of evidence or individuals for prosecution cause major foreign policy problems or complicate ongoing Intelligence and diplomatic activities" does not justify subordinating Law Enforcement. In many foreign countries, American Law Enforcement agents and their local activities are eagerly welcomed by the foreign governments who are concerned with stopping their national crime problems. There may be more distrust of American Intelligence. Since the majority of Law Enforcement cases are overt and carried out with the coordination of foreign police, there is little danger of Law Enforcement causing a "major foreign policy problem." RECOMMENDATIONS
Recommendations for the new Transnational Threats Committee:
1.This study recommends that the Committee include the Secretary of Treasury when addressing such issues as illegal smuggling and financial crimes. The agencies under the Department of Treasury, in addition to those under the Department of Justice, are actively involved in the national effort against transnational crime. Global crimes that fall under the Treasury jurisdiction include: narcotics and other contraband smuggling (U.S. Customs Service); counterfeiting American money (U.S. Secret Service); money laundering and financial crimes (Financial Crimes Enforcement Network). One obstacle to implementing this recommendation is the argument that inviting the Secretary of Treasury would be unnecessary because the Attorney General is already representing Law Enforcement in the Committee. While the departments under the Attorney General are also involved in these areas, there are some situations where Department of Treasury would be more affected and more importantly, the Committee and its national strategy would benefit from the Treasury perspective. 2.The Committee should set up a practical, working hierarchy overseas to conduct Intelligence and Law Enforcement activities under a coordinated policy. One of the stated functions of the Committee is to "develop guidelines" for coordination overseas but it is necessary to specify that the Committee needs to set up guidelines for a specific hierarchy, if coordination reforms are to be effective. There is already interest in both communities in improving coordination of activities overseas. But in actual practice, Law Enforcement often acts independently of Intelligence and vice versa because lines of authority overseas can become blurred. Problems with communication are due there not being a single person or group to lead and organize the individual activities. It is further recommended that the Chief of Station (COS) be in charge of the actual coordination of these activities. As the head of the Embassy, the Ambassador should be kept informed of both Intelligence and Law Enforcement activities but his personal involvement in the details of coordination should continue to depend on the individual Ambassador. The Committee should give the Chief of Station clear guidelines for organizing activities and the authority necessary to accomplish efficient coordination of resources. They should clearly define the COS and the Law Enforcement responsibilities to each other as well as to the Ambassador. The major obstacle could be opposition from the Attorney General and Law Enforcement officials (especially FBI) who are supportive of greater cooperation but who are rapidly increasing their activities overseas and do not want to see their freedom limited by the Chief of Station. Another concern is that unless the Committee sets up clear lines of authority, it may be difficult for the Chief of Station to coordinate activities and ensure that Law Enforcement adheres to the guidelines. 3.The Committee should form a separate proactive strategy for Global Organized Crime and Drug Trafficking Networks. The IC, in order to avoid wasting resources through duplication, must recognize the similarities between Global Organized Crime and other transnational threats. However, the different activities and potential vulnerabilities of Global Organized Crime must also be acknowledged by the Committee if it is to form an effective strategy against the threat. For example, an intelligence strategy for Global Organized Crime might focus on gathering information on the international money laundering networks. Since laundered money is necessary to continue the daily operations of these criminal networks, a concentrated multi- agency attack on the money laundering channels could be debilitating to Global Organized Crime groups and Drug Traffickers. While terrorist groups can also be involved in money laundering, this strategy may not be as successful in preventing terrorist attacks. From the other perspective, strategies used against terrorism may not prove to be as effective against organized crime. Implementing this recommendation would strengthen the national effort against Global Organized Crime by producing a coordinated strategy specific to its own concerns. The costs would be low because it would not necessarily entail devoting more resources to addressing the threat but rather using the existing resources more effectively. Certain Committee members may oppose the recommendation on the belief that it would be a waste of resources to devote the Committee and the agencies they represent to one transnational threat when they could take advantage of the similarities of the threats. However, the importance of having a "Transnational Threat" committee instead of having a "Global Organized Crime" committee already takes advantage of these similarities by pooling the leaders and resources involved in all of these threats. Within the Committee, the differences should also be recognized. 4.The Committee should create more liaison programs between Intelligence and Law Enforcement dealing with Global Organized Crime. The two communities are already participating in programs like this, but since the benefits are significant, the Committee should encourage cooperation and integration on a working level through more programs. On a case by case level, they would benefit from the different perspectives and on a higher level of authority, they would benefit from the joint programs because it would help to facilitate future cooperation. The cost of adding more joint projects is relatively small when compared with the benefits of cases that result in greater intelligence gathering/prosecutions and in less resources being used overall because manpower and technology have been shared between the communities. 5.This study recommends that the Committee make efforts to improve coordination with foreign governments. Global cooperation is necessary to fight criminal groups with increasingly interconnected networks around the world. FBI Director Freeh has been very successful in establishing working partnerships with foreign Law Enforcement and governments. He sees building "cop-to-cop" connections as the key to fighting global crime. Just as strengthening the coordination between domestic agencies is a necessary step toward a more effective national strategy, improving coordination between American and foreign agencies is also an important part of reducing Global Organized Crime One obstacle would be the reluctance of Intelligence to work even closer with foreign governments, their intelligence agencies and their Law Enforcement. In the case of Russia, many law enforcement officials accept bribes from organized crime and detectives are sometimes forced to not report to their superiors for fear that the suspects will be warned of raids and arrests. Intelligence may not want to work too closely with foreign intelligence agencies in order to protect their sources and methods. However, there is always an intelligence problem of trust when dealing with human sources but the successes of HUMINT demonstrate that the benefits are worth the risks. 6.This study concurs with the HUMINT and Non-proliferation conference studies' recommendation for further use of HUMINT in dealing with transnational threats. These underground networks can be penetrated by human sources. Human agents can learn the complexities and vulnerabilities of an international network of criminal individuals and groups. The expensive satellite imagery that was helpful in collecting information on large military sites during the Cold War may not be that effective in collecting information on Global Organized Crime. There are more risks involved in trusting human sources but it is more effective in dealing with Global Organized Crime and the costs are low when compared with technical collection. Recommendations for the President: 7.This study recommends that the President confer regularly with the Transnational Threats Committee while forming his national strategy on Global Organized Crime. The new Committee offers the President an incredible opportunity to combine all of the separate abilities and interests represented by the DCI, the Attorney General, the Secretaries of State and Defense, under a unified set of anti-global crime objectives. Since IAA97 also states that the President may designate additional members, he has even more opportunities to use the Committee to respond to his needs with regard to transnational threats. The major obstacle is the President's own disapproval of the creation of the Committee. In his statement on signing the Authorization Act regarding the new Committee, he wrote, "Such efforts to dictate the President's policy process unduly intrude upon Executive prerogatives and responsibilities. I would note that under my Executive authority, I have already asked the NSC to examine these issues." The combined decisions of Intelligence and Law Enforcement leaders should provide insights into creating a coordinated policy that the NSC had previously not provided. The President frequently speaks about the importance of addressing transnational threats so he should be more interested in forming an effective solution-oriented policy against them. 8.The President should support the continuation of both the Attorney General and the Secretary of Treasury acting as representatives of Law Enforcement. The President should not select the Attorney General as the single representative for Law Enforcement. The Attorney General already acts as the Law Enforcement spokesperson in many areas dealing with Global Organized Crime. In areas that pertain more to the Treasury, such as financial crimes, the Secretary should continue to be brought in as a representative. MEASURING SUCCESS OF THE REFORMED INTELLIGENCE RESPONSE TO GLOBAL ORGANIZED CRIME
9.The Transnational Threats Committee should make formal annual assessments on the effects of the changes made through the reforms described above and address the weaknesses in the implementation. Reform and improvement of coordination should be a continuous process and the Committee needs to form a systematic way to continue reform of Intelligence and Law Enforcement coordination and the national response to Global Organized Crime. Possible areas for them to examine would be if there was a more cohesive national strategy; if activities overseas were actually being coordinated under the Chief of Station or if Law Enforcement officials were acting independently; and if, as a result of the reforms, there were improvements made in the Global Organized Crime assessments given to policy-makers. The President and his staff should also make a yearly assessment of the success of the Committee. He should provide feedback on how the Committee could better respond to transnational threats and provide him with information relevant to formulating a national strategy. Actual trends in Global Organized Crime and individual cases of major crime groups should be analyzed to determine if the coordinated response formulated by the Committee had an impact on the threat.

ARCPR: CRITICAL REFLECTIONS ON INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZED CRIME, MONEY LAUNDERING, AND CORRUPTION The Canadian Review of Policing Research (2004) ISSN: 1710 6915 CRITICAL REFLECTIONS ON INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZED CRIME, MONEY LAUNDERING, AND CORRUPTION Margaret. E. Beare
Margaret Beare
is an associate professor in the Sociology Department of York University and the Director of the Nathanson Centre for the Study of Organized Crime and Corruption at Osgoode Hall Law School, York University. What follows is a summary of a recently published book entitled Critical Reflections on Transnational Organized Crime, Money Laundering, and Corruption, published in 2003 by the University of Toronto Press, Toronto, Canada. Dr. Beare’s e-mail address is mbeare@yorku.ca. This book features the work of eleven international scholars who were asked to examine the policing and politics that surround transnational crime, organized crime, money laundering and corruption. Most countries are under pressure to respond to such criminal challenges in a uniform manner in accordance with numerous international agreements, conventions, and guidelines; but some critics are concerned about what might be described as a gradual “Americanization” of international policing practices and policies 1
. They are especially concerned about the high priority placed on proceeds of crime and money laundering. This book emphasizes the significance of transnational crimes or organized criminal activity, the impact of illegal proceeds of crime upon specific markets, and the diverse forms of corruption they create. The various articles challenge some of the current political preoccupations with these issues and attempt to compare rhetoric with more empirically-based realities. Themes and Structure of the Book The book explores a number of common themes: the exploitable nature of taking organized crime as problem; the non-empirical basis for much of the media, police, and political responses; and the unintended consequences that can result from well-intentioned enforcement initiatives. Of additional interest are the policing and security industries that have grown up to “combat” organized crime and corruption, and whose livelihoods benefit from the high priority assigned to these forms of criminality. Contributing Authors Chapter One
on “Transnational Organized Crime: The Strange Career of an American Concept” is written by Michael Woodiwiss. 2
He provides us with a historical mapping of the American roots of our current understanding of what has become known as organized crime, and traces not only the antiquity of concern over organized crime but the distortion of our current focus. Power and politics have a determining influence on the definitions of ‘organized crime’ in the present international community. Chapter Two
by Tom Naylor, 3
is entitled “Predators, Parasites, or Free-market Pioneers: Reflections on the Nature and Analysis of Profit-Driven Crime”. It asks the reader to re-examine at a more micro-level the claims that are typically made about profit-driven crimes. He establishes three classifications of profit-driven crimes: predatory crimes for profit, which involve involuntary transfers; market-based exchanges in which illegal goods or services are sold for profit; and commercial exchanges which are the illegal production or illegal distribution of otherwise legal goods or services. Each of these categories of profit-driven crime has a different impact on society, and that impact is not always negative. Hence, societal responses, particularly those of law enforcement agencies, might be wise to differentiate rather than to group together all profit-driven criminal activity under the heading of “organized crime”. Chapter Three,
“From National to Global, from Empirical to Legal: The Ambivalent Concept of Transnational Organized Crime”, is written by Valsimas Mitsilegas. 4
His chapter provides the current European interpretation of legislation in Italy, Germany, the United Kingdom, the European Union and the United Nations. He documents the vague, ill-defined national and organizational responses. His analysis outlines the emergence of the organized-crime offence at the global level, and examines anti-organized crime initiatives against a backdrop of fundamental legal principles, thereby revealing the negotiations and compromises that go into obtaining multi-jurisdictional agreements. Chapter Four, “The Business of Bribery: Globalization, Economic Liberalization, and the ‘Problem’ of Corruption”, is written by James Williams 5
and Margaret Beare, 6
and takes on the issue of transparency. The chapter examines the role of the World Bank, International Monetary Fund and other international organizations such as Transparency International in packaging the current focus on one specific form of corruption, namely that which hinders the economies of the more developed countries. The chapter traces the growing response of international communities to corruption, and argues that globalization has created new political and economic spaces that are being largely filled by initiatives that conform to an economic logic defined by the developed world. International organizations that appear to have separate voices are all reading from the same script: a script that supports global business and finance. Chapter Five
is entitled “Against Transnational Organized Crime, and is written by James Sheptycki. 7
It examines the language that has grown around the activities subsumed under “transnational organized crime”. Sheptycki describes the veil being drawn over police work as policing becomes increasingly international and takes on a new rhetoric of transnational organized crime. The police apparatus now includes security forces and elite squads operating according to diverse international standards. In this new order, traditional accountability mechanisms are no longer adequate. The hard-won advances towards visibility in domestic policing are undermined by the call for all-out war against transnational organized crime. Chapter Six
by Kyle Grayson 8
on “Discourse, Identity, and the US ‘War on Drugs’”, analyses from a Foucaultian perspective the foreign policies of the United States against drug trafficking. He examines the rhetoric of both the “war on drugs” and the “security-threat” that has succeeded in merging drugs with the traditional discourses of transnational crime. His objective in this chapter is to understand both the reasons why the United States has chosen to link drugs with security and the methods by which this linkage has been made. Chapter Seven
on ‘Global Markets and Crime”, is written by Vincenzo Ruggiero. 9
It presents case materials that illustrate the role of ‘legitimate’ professionals in facilitating many ‘transnational’ crimes. He argues that white-collar crime and organized crime are increasingly blurred within the international cross-jurisdictional criminal environment. Vincenzo Ruggiero emphasizes the close links between legitimate business and illegitimate operations and argues that forms of social control help to determine the forms that crime will take. He sees “globalization” changing social control mechanisms, in turn causing changes in criminal activity. One result is an increasingly blurred relationship between the concepts of white-collar crime and organized crime. Cases are presented that illustrate the role of corporations and other ‘legitimate’ segments of society in supporting or facilitating criminal activity. After these somewhat theoretical papers, the remaining four chapters examine more concrete law enforcement issues. In Chapter eight, “Organized Corporate Criminality: Corporate Complicity in Tobacco Smuggling”, Margaret Beare examines in detail one example of a white-collar-organized crime. The tobacco industry has been shown to have operated in identical ways to more traditional notions of organized criminals: actively engaged in smuggling, fraud, money laundering and violence. The revelations concerning the tobacco corporations lead us to question why they have avoided being labelled criminal for so long. While some of their immunity relates to the general difficulty with proving white-collar crime, other equally valid reasons relate to the power of the corporations, and the limited range of people to whom we apply the term “organized criminal” or, for that, matter apply the criminal law. Chapter Nine, “The War on Drugs and the Military: The Case of Colombia”, by Juan Gabriel Ronderos, 10
challenges the rhetoric of the “war” on drugs, and law-enforcement responses arising from the foreign policies that underlie the rhetoric. He examines the consequences of such policies and law enforcement on a country such as Colombia, and shows the unintended consequences of misdirected enforcement strategies or misguided priorities. Chapter Ten
is entitled “Drug Trafficking and Organized Crime in Canada: A Study of High-level Drug Networks” ad is written by Fred Desroches. 11
He demonstrates empirically that the popular rhetoric about so-called “high-level drug traffickers” is largely false. His study 12
is part of a growing body of empirical research suggesting that even high-level drug traffickers come in many different types and that the members of a network engage in many different working arrangements among its members. The key finding is that the majority of traffickers are individual entrepreneurs who could quit, aspire to move up in the illicit occupational chain, or change and work with the competition. His study, based on interviews with high-level drug traffickers in prisons across Canada, dispels some of the myths about these criminals and their relationship to the larger entity collectively termed “organized crime”. If these criminals are not as imagined, perhaps other unverified assumptions about organized criminal groups should be questioned. Chapter Eleven
brings the book to an end with “Follow-the-Money Methods in Crime Control Policy”, a second chapter by Tom Naylor. It was written specifically for the Nathanson Centre for the Study of Organized Crime and Corruption on discusses the inherent fallacies of enforcement strategies directed against money laundering and proceeds of crime. Naylor examines forfeiture laws and the prime international policing strategy of going after illicit money. He challenges the assumptions upon which the prioritizing of anti-money laundering initiatives is based and suggests alternative approaches.

CHINESE TRANSNATIONAL ORGANIZED CRIME: THE FUK CHING
by James O. Finckenauer, Ph.D. International Center National Institute of Justice Organizational Structure
The organizational structure of Chinese organized crime in the United States is quite complex. Broadly defined, there is a great variety of Chinese criminal organizations. These include gangs, secret societies, triads, tongs, Taiwanese organized crime groups, and strictly US-based tongs and gangs. According to Ko-lin Chin, the foremost academic expert in the U.S. on Chinese organized crime, there is no empirical support for the belief that there is a well-organized, monolithic, hierarchical criminal cartel called the ?Chinese Mafia.? Chin says: ?My findings...do not support the notion that a chain of command exists among these various crime groups or that they coordinate with one another routinely in international crimes such as heroin trafficking, money laundering, and the smuggling of aliens? (1996:123). In order to simplify and focus our discussion, this analysis will concentrate on the Fuk Ching gang. The Fuk Ching are active in New York City, and are regarded as one of the most powerful, and also transnationally active, Chinese organized crime groups in the U.S. (Chin, 1996). They are estimated to have approximately 35 members, with another 20 members currently in prison. Other major gangs in New York City include the Ghost Shadows, Flying Dragons, Tung On, and Born-to-Kill. The New York City gangs, like the Fuk Ching, mainly operate extortion and protection rackets in defined neighborhoods in New York?s Chinatown. Their victims are mostly businesses in Chinatown. In California, the Chinese organized crime presence and problem is quite different from that in New York. In California, the dominant groups are the Wo Hop To and the the Wah Ching. One of the structural characteristics that makes Chinese organized crime different from other forms is the relationship between some of the street gangs and certain adult organizations. The latter are called tongs. The Fuk Ching, for example, are affiliated with the Fukien American Association. The Fukien American Association ? as with other tongs and their relationships with gangs ? provide the Fuk Ching with a physical place to gather and hang out. They allow the gang to operate on their (the tong?s) territory, thus legitimizing them with the community. They also provide criminal opportunities (such as protecting gambling operations), as well as supplying money and guns. The Fuk Ching originally emerged in New York in the mid-1980s, and as with other gangs, their main criminal activity in Chinatown was extortion. They were founded by a collection of young men (youth in their late teens and early twenties) from Fujian province in China -- many if not all of whom had criminal records in China. Fuk Ching recruitment today continues to be among Fujianese teenagers. Tong-affiliated gangs, like the Fuk Ching, have an ah kung (grandfather) or shuk foo (uncle) who is their tong leader. The top gang position is the dai dai lo (big big brother). Communicationbetween the tong and the gang occurs principally between these two individuals. Below the dai dai lo in descending order are the dai lo(s) or big brothers, the yee lo/saam lo (clique leaders), and at the bottom the ma jai or little horses. There are a variety of norms and rules that govern the gangs. These include respecting the ah kung, beating up members of other gangs on your turf, not using drugs, following the orders of the dai lo, and not betraying the gang. Rules violators are punished, sometimes severely, such as through physical assault and killing. Violence
Our research and our interviews with various experts confirms that violence is a defining characteristic of Chinese criminal gangs. Use of violence within the group and against other organized crime groups is very prevalent. Disputes over territory and criminal markets among the gangs are typically resolved using kong so, a process of peaceful negotiation. When this does not occur, however, the resolution is usually a violent one, in which guns are used against rival gang members. Law enforcement authorities believe that an escalation of gang violence has taken place in recent years, due in part to the advent of the Fuk Ching, and to gang involvement in alien smuggling activities. Based on his research, Chin concludes the following with respect to Chinese gang violence in general: The capacity for violence appears to be one of the key defining characteristics of street gang culture. Its employment, however, is shaped and determined by a cluster of constraints related to profit-generating goals. Violence between and among gangs is regulated through an agent or ah kung who attempts to channel aggressive behavior in ways that effectively maintain gang coherence. Gang coherence in turn supports the gang?s involvement in extortion activities and in the provision of protection services to organized vice industries in the community (Chin, 1996:138). The Fuk Ching are violent, but their use of violence is not very sophisticated nor specialized. It is not the systematic use of violence (including threats) to protect and gain monopoly control of criminal markets that is associated with mature forms of organized crime. Instead it is more likely to be random street level violence, with guns, employed by anyone in the gang. Sometimes this violence is sanctioned and sometimes not. Economic Resources
Understanding alien smuggling to be the illegal movement of migrants across national borders, and human trafficking to be migrant smuggling that includes coercion and exploitation, the Fuk Ching are extensively involved in both types of activities. Indeed, these criminal activities, along with kidnapping, are the main transnational crimes of the Fuk Ching. Their dominance is related to Fujian Province being the principal source of Chinese being smuggled and trafficked into North America. On the domestic scene, their main criminal activities in New York City?s Chinatown are extortion and gambling. Each Chinese gang dominates these crimes in theirparticular Chinatown neighborhoods. This includes the Fuk Ching. The professionalism and sophistication of the Fuk Ching are quite low, again as compared to more mature forms of organized crime. The same is true of other Chinese criminal gangs operating in the United States. This may be due to their being generally much younger than, for example, LCN or Russian organized crime figures. Also, their criminal activities are not particularly sophisticated, although the Fuk Ching may be becoming more complex in their organizational structure as they become more heavily engaged in human trafficking. In his research, Chin (1996) found that Chinese gangs were quite active in legitimate businesses in New York City?s Chinatown. For example, they owned or operated restaurants, retail stores, vegetable stands, car services, ice cream parlors, fish markets, and video stores. On a higher, more professional level, they also owned or operated wholesale supply firms, factories, banks, and employment agencies. In addition, on the West Coast Chinese gangs are believed to have penetrated the entertainment industry. Perhaps it is because of their relatively small size, the youth of their members, their lack of business experience and acumen, and the geographical constraints in which they operate, that Chinese gangs such as the Fuk Ching do not seem to play significant roles in the broader legitimate economy. Political Resources
The expert consensus is that the Fuk Ching, like other Chinese gangs, do not have the connections and stature to make them capable of corrupting U.S. police and judges. There have been only one or two cases of police corruption (none in recent years), and no cases of judicial corruption. As to political influence, there is some ability to manipulate the political system via corruption in China ? namely in Fujian Province and with respect to their human trafficking enterprise. In the United States, however, there is no evidence of corrupting the political process, of getting members elected or appointed to political office, nor of being able to manage media coverage of their activities. They are influential only in Chinatown, and their connections to U.S. politicians are non-existent. Any political influence Chinese gangs have is exerted through the tongs with which they are affiliated. For example, it is reported that the head of the Fukien American Association once gave $6,500 to a New York City Mayor?s re-election campaign (Kleinknecht, 1996:168). That the affiliation is not only beneficial to the gangs is evidenced in Chin?s report that tongs and other Chinatown community organizations benefit from the Chinese gangs? threats of extortion because business owners donate money to the associations in the belief that this will buy protection (1996). There is no evidence that Chinese gangs are involved with political terrorism either abroad or at home. Nor that they are associated with armed political groups of any kind. Response of Law Enforcement
The New York City Police Department (NYPD), which polices the neighborhood in which the Fuk Ching are active, uses all the standard law enforcement practices commonly used to combat organized crime. These include informants, undercover investigators, and electronic surveillance. In addition, both the police and the FBI support and encourage extortion victims to use hot lines to report their victimization. The NYPD has also created an Asian Gang Intelligence Unit that employs street patrols to monitor street gangs. Of the 15 Chinese crime groups indicted under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) between 1985 and 1994, one involved the Fuk Ching. In that 1993 case, 20 defendants were charged with, and pled guilty to murder. The investigation was conducted jointly by the FBI and the NYPD. On the international level, U.S. law enforcement has undertaken a number of initiatives to improve international cooperation against Chinese organized crime groups. These include the creation of the International Law Enforcement Academy (ILEA) in Bangkok, Thailand, and sponsorship of numerous international meetings on Asian organized crime. Annual meetings of the International Asian Organized Crime Conference attract more than a thousand law enforcement officials from dozens of countries. Both the ILEA and the conferences promote interaction among officials of affected countries, and lead to better cooperation and better information. Ko-lin Chin concludes that many crimes in Chinese-American communities ? especially drug trafficking, money laundering, and human trafficking ? are linked to China. He says that Chinese gang members flee to China when sought by American law enforcement. He recommends that ?deportation, extradition, joint operations, and intelligence sharing among law enforcement authorities from various countries...be carried out routinely....extradition treaties...be instated....[and that] U.S. authorities...be more culturally sensitive in dealing with foreign law enforcement agencies? (Chin, 1996:187). The External Environment
There is not general cultural acceptance of Chinese gangs such as the Fuk Ching in Chinatown. Most Chinese business owners comply with gang extortion demands because compliance is easier and less risky than resistance. As previously indicated, the gang affiliation with a tong gives them a degree of acceptability in the neighborhoods associated with that particular tong. The gang must be tolerated in order to gain any benefit that accrues from the tong. It would seem that there is little need in Chinatown for awareness raising campaigns on organized crime, or for sensitizing citizens on the dangers and threats posed by Chinese gangs. The Chinese who live in these neighborhoods are fully aware and fully sensitized. Rather than public information campaigns, Chinese businessmen would prefer a tougher criminal justice system. As Chin reports, ?they [Chinese businessmen] would like to see harsher punishment for offenders, the reinstitution of the death penalty..., and the deportation of chronic Chinese criminals? (1996:98). They also want to see many more Chinese police officers in theirneighborhoods. Because of the compartmentalized nature of Chinese organized crime in the United States, the public at large is little aware of and little concerned about what is going on in Chinatowns in U.S. cities. National media pay relatively little attention to these problems. For example, an Internet search of major U.S. newspapers under the topic ?Asian organized crime? for the period January 1, 1998 - August 1, 2000 produced only 13 articles. Chinese involvement in human smuggling, however, may be the exception to this rule. Chinese human smuggling has received considerable attention. A recent conference in Washington, DC on human smuggling pointed to five possible reasons for the high public profile given Chinese smuggling operations: (1) they are expensive; (2) associated human rights abuses are considerable; (3) they are highly efficient; (4) there is an enormous potential pool of migrants; and (5) collecting intelligence and other information from China is extraordinarily difficult (Conference Report, Transatlantic Workshop on Human Smuggling, 2000). Human trafficking activities by Chinese gangs such as the Fuk Ching are contributing to this higher profile. REFERENCES

WASHINGTON (AFP) Tuesday April 26, 2005
The
Hubble
Space
Telescope
turned 15,
with
750,000 photographs of deep space
and Earth to its credit, but its future is now uncertain. Hubble
was launched by the
Space
Shuttle Discovery on April 25, 1990, and opened a new era in astronomy. However, the
telescope, a cooperative effort of NASA and the
European Space
Agency, would not be operational until three years later. [The Hubble Space Telescope]

Enlarge The Hubble Space Telescope
A mirror that had been improperly ground was corrected in 1993, when a new camera was also installed in the
first repair mission by a space
shuttle. Once repaired, the
telescope
beamed back photographs 10 times sharper than ever before of galaxies, supernovas, giant explosions marking the
death of a star and the
birth of a black hole. Thanks to Hubble, flying above the
atmospheric distortion that hinders even more powerful Earth-based telescopes, scientists have been able to confirm that the
universe is rapidly expanding and to calculate precisely its age, at 13.7 billion years, according to NASA. Among other achievements, Hubble's observations allowed scientists to confirm the
existence of a strange form of energy called dark energy; proved the
existence of super-massive black holes; provided sharp views of a comet hitting Jupiter; and showed that the
process of forming planetary systems is common throughout the
galaxy, NASA said in a statement. NASA has so far decided not to send a shuttle to repair the
aging Hubble, citing the
450 million dollars it would cost to do so. But the
space
agency's new chief, Michael Griffin, has said he would revisit the
decision. Astronauts have serviced Hubble
four times, and many scientists hoped that a fifth service mission would be funded to enable Hubble
to function to 2011, when its infrared replacement, the
James Webb Space
Telescope, is scheduled to arrive. Currently, it is believed that Hubble's aging solar cells will provide enough energy to survive to 2007.   Hubble Space Telescope turns 15, with a galaxy of achievements

White House Cuts Hubble Servicing Mission from 2006 Budget Request Astronomers Surprised by White House Plan to Scuttle Hubble The Fight Begins Once Again for Hubble's Life By Leonard David
Senior Space Writer posted: 24 January 2005 06:44 am ET
space
A White House decision to cut funding for a Hubble Space Telescope servicing mission and dump the observatory into a remote stretch of ocean waters at a future date is sure to incite debate in scientific, engineering, and policy making circles. Intensive work has been underway at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center to develop telerobotic servicing skills for the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) in the event that a space shuttle crew is never again sent to the orbiting facility. Aerospace firms in the United States and in Canada have teamed with NASA to develop a Hubble Robotic Vehicle Deorbit Module. Either a robotic or shuttle-based servicing option reportedly would cost in excess of $1 billion. That pricetag is viewed by the White House, according to sources, as not affordable given other high-priority and more expensive efforts, such as the return-to-flight of the space shuttle program, as well as moving forward on NASA’s Moon, Mars and beyond agenda. White House plans to scuttle Hubble is part of NASA’s 2006 budget request, sources said, with some money in the budget allocated to using a propulsion module coupled to Hubble for its safe but destructive deorbiting. The cutting of the HST servicing mission from NASA’s 2006 budget request was first reported
by Space News
on its website Friday and on  SPACE.com
. Leading the fight Senator Barbara Mikulski (D-Md.), a fervent Hubble supporter whose state is home to both the Goddard Space Flight Center and the Space Telescope Science Institute, issued a statement late January 21 in which she vowed to continue advocating an HST servicing mission. "It is essential that we have a safe and reliable servicing mission to Hubble," Mikulski said, that is consistent with the findings of the Columbia Accident Investigation Board and last month’s findings of a National Academy of Sciences (NAS) panel on the Hubble issue. On December 8, in the NAS final report released by the Committee on the Assessment of Options for Extending the Life of the Hubble Space Telescope, a blue ribbon group of experts said that NASA should reinstate a space shuttle mission to refurbish the Earth-orbiting telescope. "I led the fight to add $300 million to NASA’s budget last year for a Hubble servicing mission, and I plan to lead the fight again this year. This is what the American people expect and deserve," Mikulski said in a statement.  In defense of Hubble Response to the White House decision has engendered a wait-and-see attitude in some astronomical quarters, while others have been quick to react. Hubble’s best days lie ahead, predicted John Bahcall, a professor of natural sciences at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey. In 1998, he was a recipient of the National Medal of Science for his pioneering efforts in neutrino astrophysics and his contributions to the development and planning of the Hubble Space Telescope. "President Nixon cancelled in 1973 the Hubble Telescope while it was still in the development phase. The reason was similar: other activities in the NASA budget took priority," Bahcall told SPACE.com. "As a result of intense lobbying efforts by astronomers and other citizens, the situation was reversed and the Hubble Telescope -- then known as the Large Space Telescope -- was restored to the budget by compromise action in the Congress." Bahcall said that Hubble has contributed enormously to scientific knowledge and to America’s respect abroad. The telescope represents achievements of which all Americans can be proud, he said. "I am confident that Americans of all walks of life will come to the defense of the Hubble and cause the Congress to restore the repair of the telescope to the NASA budget," Bahcall said. Telerobotic progress Excellent progress is being made on a telerobotic approach to servicing the Hubble, said Jim Crocker, vice president of civil space at Lockheed Martin Space Systems of Denver. The firm has supported NASA’s planning and then repair and servicing of the HST via four space shuttle missions to date. The telerobotics team at work at Goddard Space Flight Center "have a good shot at pulling this off," Crocker told SPACE.com
the day before the Space News
story on the White House HST decision appeared. Lockheed Martin’s role in the rocket-launched Hubble Robotic Vehicle Deorbit Module (HRVDM), Crocker said, is providing all the sensors to do the rendezvous and docking with the Hubble, as well as provide the liquid-fueled propellant module that would later deorbit the telescope. For their part, Canada’s MacDonald, Dettwiler and Associates (MDA) Ltd. -- through its MD Robotics group in Brampton, Ontario -- is providing the Dextre robot that’s part of the HRVDM. It is being specially configured to replace batteries, gyroscopes, and perhaps an instrument on the HST to extend its life. NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center is overseeing and integrating the HRVDM work. Crocker said that simulations performed at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight center have converted doubters, including him, that performing many of the scheduled Hubble servicing tasks through the tender loving care of telerobotics is feasible. "That’s not to say it’s not challenging," Crocker said, "but the team is making a convincing story." Rabbit out of the hat There’s also good news to report in keeping Hubble in an operating mode. Worry centers on HST’s gyroscopes, batteries, or other gear that might fail early, negating the observatory’s useful lifetime. "The team continues to pull rabbits out of the hat," Crocker said. For instance, a two gyro science mode, along with the needed software has been worked out. HST’s original design had to have three gyros working to do science. Additionally, a new battery management approach is being adopted. "That’s good news," Crocker said. "I’m hearing we’re likely to be able to get [HST] into 2008 now." At the end of the day, Crocker concluded, whatever option is decided upon for Hubble servicing and its ultimate reentry, "everyone on the team wants the best chance of success possible."    Sponsored Links

TREC-8 Interactive Track Guidelines
TREC-8 Interactive Track Guidelines Goal  ----  The high-level goal of the Interactive Track in TREC-8 remains the investigation of searching as an interactive task by examining the process as well as the outcome. To this end a experimental framework has been designed with the following common features:         - an interactive search task         - 6 topics         - a document collection to be searched         - a required set of searcher (demographics) questionnaires         - 6 classes of data to be collected at each site and submitted to NIST         - 3 summary measures to be calculated by NIST for use by participants The framework will allow groups to estimate the effect of their experimental manipulation free and clear of the main (additive) effects of participant and topic and it will reduce the effect of interactions. In TREC-8 the emphasis will be on each group's exploration of different approaches to supporting the common searcher task and understanding the reasons for the results they get. No formal coordination of hypotheses or comparison of systems across sites is planned for TREC-8, but groups are encouraged to seek out and exploit synergies. As a first step, groups are strongly encouraged to make the focus of their planned investigations known to other track participants as soon as possible, preferably via the track listserv at trec-int@ohsu.edu.  Contact track chair Bill Hersh
to join. General Description  -------------------  A minimum of 12 participating searchers, one experimental system, and one control system per site will be required.  The control system can be any IR system appropriate to the goals of the local experiment, e.g. a variant of the local experimental system, some other baseline system such as SMART, ZPRISE, etc.  (See "2. Augmentation" in the detailed experimental design for information about how to use more than eight searchers or more than one experimental system within this design.) Each searcher will perform six searches on the Financial Times of London 1991-1994 collection (part of the TREC-8 adhoc collection), using six topics especially chosen from the TREC-8 adhoc topics and modified for use in the interactive track.  Each searcher will perform half of the total number of searches on the site's experimental system and the other half on its control system.  The experimental design (see below) determines the order in which each searcher performs the query and uses the systems (experimental and control). In resolving experimental design questions not covered here (e.g., scheduling of tutorials and searches, etc.), participating sites should try to minimize the differences between the conditions under which a given searcher uses the control and those under which s/he uses the experimental system. For example, running all the control searches for a participant on one day and the searches on the experimental system on another invites unequal, confounding conditions. Topics ------ Each of the topics will describe a need for information of a particular type. Contained within the documents of the collection to be searched will be multiple distinct examples or instances of the needed information. The interactive topics will be modified versions of specially selected adhoc topics. Here is an example TREC-6 adhoc topic:         Number: 303          Title: Hubble Telescope Achievements          Description:          Identify positive accomplishments of the Hubble telescope          since it was launched in 1991.         Narrative:          Documents are relevant that show the Hubble telescope has          produced new data, better quality data than previously          available, data that has increased human knowledge of the          universe, or data that has led to disproving previously          existing theories or hypotheses.  Documents limited to the          shortcomings of the telescope would be irrelevant.  Details          of repairs or modifications to the telescope without          reference to positive achievements would not be relevant. Here is an example of the same topic as it would be modified for use in the TREC-8 interactive track. Note the addition of the "Please save" paragraph and the removal of the usual Narrative section with its specific criteria for relevance or non-relevance:         Number: 303i          Title: Hubble Telescope Achievements          Description:          Identify positive accomplishments of the Hubble telescope          since it was launched in 1991.         Instances:         In the time alloted, please find as many DIFFERENT positive          accomplishments of the sort described above as you can.         Please save at least one document for EACH such DIFFERENT          accomplishment.         If one document discusses several such accomplishments, then          you need not save other documents that repeat those, since your          goal is to identify as many DIFFERENT accomplishments of the sort          described above as possible. Here are the topics for TREC-8 in NUMERICAL order. See the section "Experimental design for a site" below for their assignment to blocks and the order of presentation within the experimental design. Number: 408i Title: tropical storms Description: What tropical storms (hurricanes and typhoons) have caused property damage and/or loss of life? Instances: In the time alloted, please find as many DIFFERENT storms of the sort described above as you can. Please save at least one document for EACH such DIFFERENT storm. If one document discusses several such storms, then you need not save other documents that repeat those, since your goal is to identify as many DIFFERENT storms of the sort described above as possible. Number: 414i Title: Cuba, sugar, imports Description: What countries import Cuban sugar? Instances: In the time alloted, please find as many DIFFERENT countries of the sort described above as you can. Please save at least one document for EACH such DIFFERENT country. If one document discusses several such countries, then you need not save other documents that repeat those, since your goal is to identify as many DIFFERENT countries of the sort described above as possible. Number: 428i Title: declining birth rates Description: What countries other than the US and China have or have had a declining birth rate? Instances: In the time alloted, please find as many DIFFERENT countries of the sort described above as you can. Please save at least one document for EACH such DIFFERENT country. If one document discusses several such countries, then you need not save other documents that repeat those, since your goal is to identify as many DIFFERENT countries of the sort described above as possible. Number: 431i Title: robotic technology Description: What are the latest developments in robotic technology and in its use? Instances: In the time alloted, please find as many DIFFERENT developments of the sort described above as you can. Please save at least one document for EACH such DIFFERENT development. If one document discusses several such developments, then you need not save other documents that repeat those, since your goal is to identify as many DIFFERENT developments of the sort described above as possible. Number: 438i Title: tourism, increase Description: What countries have experienced an increase in tourism? Instances: In the time alloted, please find as many DIFFERENT countries of the sort described above as you can. Please save at least one document for EACH such DIFFERENT country. If one document discusses several such countries, then you need not save other documents that repeat those, since your goal is to identify as many DIFFERENT countries of the sort described above as possible. Number: 446i Title: tourists, violence Description: In what countries have tourists been subject to acts of violence causing bodily harm or death? Instances: In the time alloted, please find as many DIFFERENT countries of the sort described above as you can. Please save at least one document for EACH such DIFFERENT country. If one document discusses several such countries, then you need not save other documents that repeat those, since your goal is to identify as many DIFFERENT countries of the sort described above as possible. Searcher task ------------- The task of the interactive searcher is to save documents, which, taken together, contain as many different instances as possible of  the type of information the topic expresses a need for - within a 20 minute time limit. Searchers will be encouraged to avoid saving documents which contribute no instances beyond those in documents already saved, but there will be no scoring penalty for saving such documents and searchers will be told that. Instructions to be given to searchers ------------------------------------- The following introductory instructions are to be given once to each searcher before the first search:         "Imagine that you have just returned from a visit to your doctor          during which it was discovered that you are suffering from high         blood pressure. The doctor suggests that you take a new experimental         drug, but you wonder what alternative treatments are currently          available.  You decide to investigate the literature on your own         to satisfy your need for information about what different          alternatives are available to you for high blood pressure treatment.         You really need only one document for each of the different          treatments for high blood pressure.          You find and save a single document that lists four treatment drugs.         Then you find and save another two documents that each discusses a         separate alternative treatment: one that discusses the use of         calcium and one that talks about regular exercise.  You've run out          of time and stop your search. In all, you have identified six          different instances of alternative treatments in three documents.          ---         In this experiment, you will face a similar task. You will be          presented with several descriptions of needed information on a          number of topics. In each case there can be multiple examples or          instances of the type of information that's needed.         We would like you to identify as many different instances as you         can of the needed information for each topic that will be presented          to you -  as many as you can in the 20 minutes you will be given          to search.  Please save one document for EACH DIFFERENT instance          of the needed information that you identify. If you save one          document that contains several instances, try not to save additional         documents that contain ONLY those instances. However, you will not          be penalized if you save documents unnecessarily.           As you identify an instance of the needed information, please keep          track of which instances you have found: write down a word or short          phrase to identify the instance, or--if the system provides a          facility to keep track of instances--use it.                  Carefully read each topic to understand the type of information          needed. This will vary from topic to topic. On one topic you may be          looking for instances of a certain kind of event. On another you may          be searching for examples of certain sorts of people, places, or          things.         Do you have any questions about          - what we mean by instances of needed information          - the way in which you are to save nonredundant documents for each           instance?" Searcher questionnaires (minimum) ----------------------- Provided by Rutgers (see track web site) Data to be collected and submitted to NIST (emailed to over@nist.gov) ------------------------------------------ Several sorts of result data will be collected for evaluation/analysis (for all searches unless otherwise specified):    ===>  Due at NIST by 30. August 1999:         1. sparse format data       ===>  Due at NIST by when the site reports for the conference are due:         2. rich format data         3. a full narrative description of one interactive session for            whichever topic is designated as T1         4. any further guidance or refinement of the task specification            given to the searchers         5. data from the common searcher questionnaires Sparse format data for each search will comprise the list of documents saved and the elapsed clock time of the search. The searcher's selection (choice) of items for the final output list must be identified in terms of each document's TREC document identifier (DOCNO). The elapsed (clock) time in seconds taken for the search, from the time the searcher first sees the topic until s/he declares the search to be finished, should be recorded.  It is assumed that the interactive search takes place in one uninterrupted session.  If a session is unavoidably interrupted, it is recommended that it be abandoned and the topic given to another searcher.  Sparse format data will be the basis for the summary evaluation at NIST, which will produce a triple for each search: instance precision, instance recall, and elapsed clock time. Rich format data for each search will record: - the word or phrase each searcher records to describe each   instance s/he identifies (no reference to the containing document(s)) - significant events in the course of the interaction and their    timing.             Rich format data are intended for analytical evaluation by the            experimenters.             All significant events and their timing in the course of the            interaction should be recorded.  The events listed below are those            that seem to be fairly generally applicable to different systems            and interactive environments; however, the list may need extending            or modifying for specific systems and so should be taken as a            suggestion rather than a requirement:           o Intermediate search formulations:  if appropriate to the              system, these should be recorded.           o Documents viewed:  "viewing" is taken to mean the searcher              seeing a title or some other brief information about a              document; these events should be recorded.           o Documents seen:  "seeing" is taken to mean the searcher              seeing the text of a document, or a substantial section of              text; these events should be recorded.            o Terms entered by the searcher:  if appropriate to the              system, these should be recorded.           o Terms seen (offered by the system):  if appropriate to the              system, these should be recorded.           o Selection/rejection:  documents or terms selected by the              user for any further stage of the search (in addition to the              final selection of documents).  Format of sparse data to be submitted to NIST --------------------------------------------- TWO files from each site            A. Search file         Here a "search" is the interaction of a searcher given a topic         and asked to carry out the interactive search task using a given          system against the collection - lasting at most 20 minutes.         One line for EACH SEARCH, each line containing the          following blank-delimited items from left to right:                 1. Unique site ID                 2. Search ID  - site's choice (links search & document files)                 3. Searcher ID - site's choice                 4. System ID - site's choice                 5. TREC topic number                                          6. Elapsed time - number of secs., fractions truncated                    Clock time from the moment the searcher sees the                     topic until the moment the searcher indicates the                     search is complete or time is up.   B. Documents file         One line for each document in a given search result,         each line containing the following blank-delimited         items from left to right:                 1. Chronological sequence number ( "1", "2") within a search                    Use number of last time saved if saved multiple times.                          2. Search ID (from search file)                 3. TREC document identifier (DOCNO)              NOTE: Reported data items listed within each line must NOT          contain whitespace.      Format of other data to be submitted to NIST -------------------------------------------- Data other than that in sparse-format should be submitted as ASCII text files. The FA-1 score plus the questionaire data for each searcher should be  submitted in a separate file with format close to the following example but with the real responses to the right of the colons. The Tutorial Worksheet and Experimenter Note need not be submitted.         S i t e:         S e a r c h e r  I D:         FA-1 score:  ?         P r e - s e a r c h :                   (1 per searcher)         Searcher:       id         Condition:      ?         Degrees:        degree major date         Degrees:        degree major date         Degrees:        degree major date         Degrees:        degree major date         Degrees:        degree major date         Occupation:     ...         Gender:         M | F         Age:            nn         Previous TREC:  Y | N         Online searching: nn         Q1:             1-5         Q2:             1-5         Q3:             1-5         Q4:             1-5         Q5:             1-5         Q6:             1-5         Q7:             1-5         Q8:             1-5         S e a r c h :                           (8 per searcher)         Searcher:       id         Condition:      ?         Topic #:        nnn         Q1:             1-5         Q2:             1-5         Q3:             1-5         Q4:             1-5         Q5:             1-5         Q6:             1-5         P o s t - s y s t e m :                 (2 per searcher)         Searcher:       id         Condition:      ?         Q1:             1-5         Q2:             1-5         Q3:             1-5         Comments:       ...         S e a r c h e r   w o r k s h e e t :   (8 per searcher)         Searcher:       id         Condition:      ?         Topic #:        nnn         1.              ...         2.              ...         3.              ...         .         .         .                  E x i t :                               (1 per searcher)         Searcher        id         Q1:             1-5         Q2:             1-5         Q3:             1-5         Q4:             one-system's-name       rank                         other-system's-name     rank         Q5:             one-system's-name       rank                         other-system's-name     rank         Q6:             one-system's-name       rank                         other-system's-name     rank         Q7:             ...         Q8:             ...         Q9:             ... Evaluation of data submitted to NIST ------------------------------------ Evaluation by NIST of the sparse format data will proceed as follows. For each topic, a pool will be formed containing the unique documents saved by at least one searcher for that topic regardless of site. For each topic, the NIST assessor, normally the topic author, will be asked  to:         - read the topic carefully          - read each of the documents from the pool for that topic and            gradually:            - create a list of instances of the topic's needed information              type found somewhere in the documents            - select and record a short phrase describing each instance found            - determine which documents contain which instances            - bracket each instance in the text of the document in which it               was found For each search (by a given participant for a given topic at a given site),  NIST will use the submitted list of selected documents and the assessor's instance-document mapping for the topic to calculate:         - the fraction of total instances (as determined by the assessor) for            the topic that are covered by the submitted documents (i.e.,            instance recall)         - the fraction of the submitted documents which contain one or more           instances (i.e., instance precision)   The third measure, elapsed clock time, will be taken directly from the  submitted results for each search. Experimental design for a site ------------------------------   1. Minimal experimental matrix as run     The design for this year's track departs from last year's.  One limitation     of last year's balanced block design was the potential statistical     confouding of topic and its order.  A design that controls for query order     leads to a simpler statistical analysis of results.     As such, this year's approach will insure that each query is searched in     each position (first through sixth) by each system.  This requires a     minimum of 12 searchers per site.  In addition, the query orders for     each site will need to be generated in a pseudorandom fashion.  To make     this process consistent, the query orders will be generated by the OHSU     group.  Below is an example of system-query order for a site.  (NOTE:     Please do not use this example, as new sets must be generated for each     12-searcher block.)                  Subject       Block #1           Block #2                      1      System 1: 6-1-2    System 2: 3-4-5                      2      System 2: 1-2-3    System 1: 4-5-6                      3      System 2: 2-3-4    System 1: 5-6-1                      4      System 2: 3-4-5    System 1: 6-1-2                      5      System 1: 4-5-6    System 2: 1-2-3                      6      System 1: 5-6-1    System 2: 2-3-4                      7      System 2: 6-1-2    System 1: 3-4-5                      8      System 1: 1-2-3    System 2: 4-5-6                      9      System 1: 2-3-4    System 2: 5-6-1                     10      System 1: 3-4-5    System 2: 6-1-2                     11      System 2: 4-5-6    System 1: 1-2-3                     12      System 2: 5-6-1    System 1: 2-3-4     Query blocks should be requested from Bill Hersh
as early as possible.   2. Augmentation      The design for a given site can be augmented in two ways:        1. Participants can be added in groups of 6 using the design           above.  Additional blocks should be requested from Bill           Hersh.        2. Systems can be added by adding additional groups of 6 users           with each new system.  Additional blocks should be requested           Bill Hersh.      Topics cannot be added/subtracted individually for each site.       All augmentations other than the two listed above, however interesting,       are outside the scope of this design. If sites plan such adjunct       experiments, they are encouraged to design them for maximal synergy       with the track design.  3. Analysis      Up to each group, but all are strongly encouraged to take advantage      of the experimental design and undertake:         1. exploratory data analysis            to examine the patterns of correlation, interaction, etc.            involving the major factors. Some example plots for the TREC-6            interactive data (recall or precision by searcher or topic)            are available on the Interactive Track web site            <> under "Interactive Track History".                     2. analysis of variance (ANOVA), where appropriate,            to estimate the separate contributions of searcher, topic and             system as a first step in understanding why the results of one             search are different from those of another Last updated: Wednesday, 20-Aug-03 07:33:34 Date created: Monday, 31-Jul-00 For information about this webpage contact Paul Over

TREC-7 Interactive Track Guidelines
TREC-7 Interactive Track Guidelines Goal ---- The high-level goal of the Interactive Track in TREC-7 remains the investigation of searching as an interactive task by examining the process as well as the outcome. To this end a experimental framework has been designed with the following common features: - an interactive search task - 8 topics - a document collection to be searched - a required set of searcher (demographics) questionnaires - a required psychometric test for all searchers - 6 classes of data to be collected at each site and submitted to NIST - 3 summary measures to be calculated by NIST for use by participants The framework will allow groups to estimate the effect of their experimental manipulation free and clear of the main (additive) effects of participant and topic and it will reduce the effect of interactions. In TREC-7 the emphasis will be on each group's exploration of different approaches to supporting the common searcher task and understanding the reasons for the results they get. No formal coordination of hypotheses or comparison of systems across sites is planned for TREC-7, but groups are encouraged to seek out and exploit synergies. As a first step, groups are strongly encouraged to make the focus of their planned investigations known to other track participants as soon as possible. General Description ------------------- A minimum of eight participating searchers, one experimental system, and one control system per site will be required. The control system can be any IR system appropriate to the goals of the local experiment, e.g. a variant of the local experimental system, some other baseline system such as SMART, ZPRISE, etc. (See "2. Augmentation" in the detailed experimental design for information about how to use more than eight searchers or more than one experimental system within this design.) Each searcher will perform eight searches on the Financial Times of London 1991-1994 collection (part of the TREC-7 adhoc collection), using eight topics especially chosen from the TREC-7 adhoc topics and modified for use in the interactive track. Each searcher will perform half of the total number of searches on the site's experimental system and the other half on its control system. The detailed experimental design (see below) determines the order in which each searcher uses the systems (experimental and control). In resolving experimental design questions not covered here (e.g., scheduling of tutorials and searches, etc.), participating sites should try to minimize the differences between the conditions under which a given searcher uses the control and those under which s/he uses the experimental system. For example, running all the control searches for a participant on one day and the searches on the experimental system on another invites unequal, confounding conditions. Topics ------ Each of the topics will describe a need for information of a particular type. Contained within the documents of the collection to be searched will be multiple distinct examples or instances of the needed information. The interactive topics will be modified versions of specially selected adhoc topics. Here is an example TREC-6 adhoc topic: Number: 303i Title: Hubble Telescope Achievements Description: Identify positive accomplishments of the Hubble telescope since it was launched in 1991. Narrative: Documents are relevant that show the Hubble telescope has produced new data, better quality data than previously available, data that has increased human knowledge of the universe, or data that has led to disproving previously existing theories or hypotheses. Documents limited to the shortcomings of the telescope would be irrelevant. Details of repairs or modifications to the telescope without reference to positive achievements would not be relevant. Here is an example of the same topic as it would be modified for use in the TREC-7 interactive track. Note the addition of the "Please save" paragraph and the removal of the usual Narrative section with its specific criteria for relevance or non-relevance: Number: 303i Title: Hubble Telescope Achievements Description: Identify positive accomplishments of the Hubble telescope since it was launched in 1991. Instances: In the time alloted, please find as many DIFFERENT positive accomplishments of the sort described above as you can. Please save at least one document for EACH such DIFFERENT accomplishment. If one document discusses several such accomplishments, then you need not save other documents that repeat those, since your goal is to identify as many DIFFERENT accomplishments of the sort described above as possible. Here are the topics for TREC-7 in NUMERICAL order. See the section "Experimental design for a site" below for their assignment to blocks and the order of presentation within the experimental design. ------------------------------------------------------------------------- Number: 352i Title: British Chunnel impacts Description: Impacts of the Chunnel - anticipated or actual - on the British economy and/or the life style of the British Instances: In the time alloted, please find as many DIFFERENT impacts of the sort described above as you can. Please save at least one document for EACH such DIFFERENT impact. If one document discusses several such impacts, then you need not save other documents that repeat those, since your goal is to identify as many DIFFERENT impacts of the sort described above as possible. ------------------------------------------------------------------------- Number: 353i Title: Antarctic exploration Description: Identify systematic explorations and scientific investigations of Antarctica, current or planned. Instances: In the time alloted, please find as many DIFFERENT explorations or investigations of the sort described above as you can. Please save at least one document for EACH such DIFFERENT exploration or investigation. If one document discusses several such investigations/explorations, then you need not save other documents that repeat those, since your goal is to identify as many DIFFERENT investigations or explorations of the sort described above as possible. ------------------------------------------------------------------------- Number: 357i Title: territorial waters dispute Description: Identify documents discussing international boundary disputes relevant to the 200-mile special economic zones or 12-mile territorial waters subsequent to the passing of the "International Convention on the Law of the Sea". Instances: In the time alloted, please find as many DIFFERENT disputes of the sort described above as you can. Please save at least one document for EACH such DIFFERENT dispute. If one document discusses several such disputes, then you need not save other documents that repeat those, since your goal is to identify as many DIFFERENT disputes of the sort described above as possible. ------------------------------------------------------------------------- Number: 362i Title: human smuggling Description: Identify incidents of human smuggling. Instances: In the time alloted, please find as many DIFFERENT incidents of the sort described above as you can. Please save at least one document for EACH DIFFERENT incident of the sort described above. If one document discusses several such incidents, then you need not save other documents that repeat those, since your goal is to identify DIFFERENT incidents of the sort described above. ------------------------------------------------------------------------- Number: 365i Title: El Nino Description: What effects have been attributed to El Nino? Instances: In the time alloted, please find as many DIFFERENT effects of the sort described above as you can. Please save at least one document for EACH such DIFFERENT effect. If one document discusses several such effects, then you need not save other documents that repeat those, since your goal is to identify as many DIFFERENT effects of the sort described above as possible. ------------------------------------------------------------------------- Number: 366i Title: commercial cyanide uses Description: What are the industrial or commercial uses of cyanide or its derivatives? Instances: In the time alloted, please find as many DIFFERENT uses of the sort described above as you can. Please save at least one document for EACH such DIFFERENT use. If one document discusses several such uses, then you need not save other documents that repeat those, since your goal is to identify as many DIFFERENT uses of the sort described above as possible. ------------------------------------------------------------------------- Number: 387i Title: radioactive waste Description: Identify documents that discuss effective and safe ways to permanently handle long-lived radioactive wastes. Instances: In the time alloted, please find as many DIFFERENT ways of the sort described above as you can. Please save at least one document for EACH such DIFFERENT way. If one document discusses several such ways, then you need not not save other documents that repeat those, since your goal is to identify as many DIFFERENT ways of the sort described above as possible. ------------------------------------------------------------------------- Number: 392i Title: robotics Description: What are the applications of robotics in the world today? Instances: In the time alloted, please find as many DIFFERENT applications of the sort described above as you can. Please save at least one document for EACH such DIFFERENT application. If one document discusses several such applications, then you need not save other documents that repeat those, since your goal is to identify as many DIFFERENT applications of the sort described above as possible. ------------------------------------------------------------------------- Searcher task ------------- The task of the interactive searcher is to save documents, which, taken together, contain as many different instances as possible of the type of information the topic expresses a need for - within a 15 minute time limit. Searchers will be encouraged to avoid saving documents which contribute no instances beyond those in documents already saved, but there will be no scoring penalty for saving such documents and searchers will be told that. Instructions to be given to searchers ------------------------------------- The following introductory instructions are to be given once to each searcher before the first search: "Imagine that you have just returned from a visit to your doctor during which it was discovered that you are suffering from high blood pressure. The doctor suggests that you take a new experimental drug, but you wonder what alternative treatments are currently available. You decide to investigate the literature on your own to satisfy your need for information about what different alternatives are available to you for high blood pressure treatment. You really need only one document for each of the different treatments for high blood pressure. You find and save a single document that lists four treatment drugs. Then you find and save another two documents that each discusses a separate alternative treatment: one that discusses the use of calcium and one that talks about regular exercise. You've run out of time and stop your search. In all, you have identified six different instances of alternative treatments in three documents. --- In this experiment, you will face a similar task. You will be presented with several descriptions of needed information on a number of topics. In each case there can be multiple examples or instances of the type of information that's needed. We would like you to identify as many different instances as you can of the needed information for each topic that will be presented to you - as many as you can in the 15 minutes you will be given to search. Please save one document for EACH DIFFERENT instance of the needed information that you identify. If you save one document that contains several instances, try not to save additional documents that contain ONLY those instances. However, you will not be penalized if you save documents unnecessarily. As you identify an instance of the needed information, please keep track of which instances you have found: write down a word or short phrase to identify the instance, or--if the system provides a facility to keep track of instances--use it. Carefully read each topic to understand the type of information needed. This will vary from topic to topic. On one topic you may be looking for instances of a certain kind of event. On another you may be searching for examples of certain sorts of people, places, or things. Do you have any questions about - what we mean by instances of needed information - the way in which you are to save nonredundant documents for each instance?" Searcher questionnaires (minimum) ----------------------- Provided by Rutgers (see track web site) Psychometric test ----------------- - FA-1 (Controlled Associations) from ETS's "Kit of Reference Tests for Cognitive Factors" (1976 Edition) Data to be collected and submitted to NIST (emailed to over@nist.gov) ------------------------------------------ Several sorts of result data will be collected for evaluation/analysis (for all searches unless otherwise specified): ===> Due at NIST by 30. August 1998: 1. sparse format data ===> Due at NIST by end of the day (Washington,DC) on 27. October 1998: 2. rich format data 3. a full narrative description of one interactive session for whichever topic is designated as T1 4. any further guidance or refinement of the task specification given to the searchers 5. data from the common searcher questionnaires 6. results from the psychometric test (FA-1) given to all searchers Sparse format data for each search will comprise the list of documents saved and the elapsed clock time of the search. The searcher's selection (choice) of items for the final output list must be identified in terms of each document's TREC document identifier (DOCNO). The elapsed (clock) time in seconds taken for the search, from the time the searcher first sees the topic until s/he declares the search to be finished, should be recorded. It is assumed that the interactive search takes place in one uninterrupted session. If a session is unavoidably interrupted, it is recommended that it be abandoned and the topic given to another searcher. Sparse format data will be the basis for the summary evaluation at NIST, which will produce a triple for each search: instance precision, instance recall, and elapsed clock time. Rich format data for each search will record: - the word or phrase each searcher records to describe each instance s/he identifies (no reference to the containing document(s)) - significant events in the course of the interaction and their timing. Rich format data are intended for analytical evaluation by the experimenters. All significant events and their timing in the course of the interaction should be recorded. The events listed below are those that seem to be fairly generally applicable to different systems and interactive environments; however, the list may need extending or modifying for specific systems and so should be taken as a suggestion rather than a requirement: o Intermediate search formulations: if appropriate to the system, these should be recorded. o Documents viewed: "viewing" is taken to mean the searcher seeing a title or some other brief information about a document; these events should be recorded. o Documents seen: "seeing" is taken to mean the searcher seeing the text of a document, or a substantial section of text; these events should be recorded. o Terms entered by the searcher: if appropriate to the system, these should be recorded. o Terms seen (offered by the system): if appropriate to the system, these should be recorded. o Selection/rejection: documents or terms selected by the user for any further stage of the search (in addition to the final selection of documents). Format of sparse data to be submitted to NIST --------------------------------------------- TWO files from each site A. Search file Here a "search" is the interaction of a searcher given a topic and asked to carry out the interactive search task using a given system against the collection - lasting at most 20 minutes. One line for EACH SEARCH, each line containing the following blank-delimited items from left to right: 1. Unique site ID 2. Search ID - site's choice (links search & document files) 3. Searcher ID - site's choice 4. System ID - site's choice 5. TREC topic number 6. Elapsed time - number of secs., fractions truncated Clock time from the moment the searcher sees the topic until the moment the searcher indicates the search is complete or time is up. B. Documents file One line for each document in a given search result, each line containing the following blank-delimited items from left to right: 1. Chronological sequence number ( "1", "2") within a search Use number of last time saved if saved multiple times. 2. Search ID (from search file) 3. TREC document identifier (DOCNO) NOTE: Reported data items listed within each line must NOT contain whitespace. Format of other data to be submitted to NIST -------------------------------------------- Data other than that in sparse-format should be submitted as ASCII text files. The FA-1 score plus the questionaire data for each searcher should be submitted in a separate file with format close to the following example but with the real responses to the right of the colons. The Tutorial Worksheet and Experimenter Note need not be submitted. S i t e: S e a r c h e r I D: FA-1 score: ? P r e - s e a r c h : (1 per searcher) Searcher: id Condition: ?

Q8: ... Q9: ... Evaluation of data submitted to NIST ------------------------------------ Evaluation by NIST of the sparse format data will proceed as follows. For each topic, a pool will be formed containing the unique documents saved by at least one searcher for that topic regardless of site. For each topic, the NIST assessor, normally the topic author, will be asked to: - read the topic carefully - read each of the documents from the pool for that topic and gradually: - create a list of instances of the topic's needed information type found somewhere in the documents - select and record a short phrase describing each instance found - determine which documents contain which instances - bracket each instance in the text of the document in which it was found For each search (by a given participant for a given topic at a given site), NIST will use the submitted list of selected documents and the assessor's instance-document mapping for the topic to calculate: - the fraction of total instances (as determined by the assessor) for the topic that are covered by the submitted documents (i.e., instance recall) - the fraction of the submitted documents which contain one or more instances (i.e., instance precision) The third measure, elapsed clock time, will be taken directly from the submitted results for each search. Experimental design for a site ------------------------------ 1. Minimal experimental matrix as run Define two blocks of four topics each, order of presentation fixed within each block: B1 = T1 -> T2 -> T3 -> T4 365i 357i 362i 352i B2 = T5 -> T6 -> T7 -> T8 366i 392i 387i 353i Participants | System,Topic --------------+-------------------- P1 | E,B1 C,B2 P2 | C,B2 E,B1 P3 | E,B2 C,B1 P4 | C,B1 E,B2 P5 | E,B1 C,B2 P6 | C,B2 E,B1 P7 | E,B2 C,B1 P8 | C,B1 E,B2 or expanded to show the individual topics: Participants | System,Topic combinations --------------+--------------------------------------------------- P1 | E,T1 E,T2 E,T3 E,T4 C,T5 C,T6 C,T7 C,T8 P2 | C,T5 C,T6 C,T7 C,T8 E,T1 E,T2 E,T3 E,T4 P3 | E,T5 E,T6 E,T7 E,T8 C,T1 C,T2 C,T3 C,T4 P4 | C,T1 C,T2 C,T3 C,T4 E,T5 E,T6 E,T7 E,T8 P5 | E,T1 E,T2 E,T3 E,T4 C,T5 C,T6 C,T7 C,T8 P6 | C,T5 C,T6 C,T7 C,T8 E T1 E,T2 E,T3 E,T4 P7 | E,T5 E,T6 E,T7 E,T8 C,T1 C,T2 C,T3 C,T4 P8 | C,T1 C,T2 C,T3 C,T4 E,T5 E,T6 E,T7 E,T8 - E = experimental system - C = Control system - site's choice - The participants (searchers) should be numbered sequentially, 1, ..., J. J must be at least 8 (see part 4 below on how to add more) Each site will randomly assign participants to the rows of its design. The order for presentation of topics to searchers at all participating sites is defined by the above design. The assignment of actual topics to T1, T2, ... T8 will be determined by NIST in collaboration with the track shortly after the interactive topics are made available. For the purposes of analysis each 4-person-by-8-topic matrix defined above will in effect be rearranged by permuting the columns (topics) so E alternates with C as in the following: Participants | System,Topic combinations --------------+--------------------------------------------------- P1 | E,T1 C,T5 E,T2 C,T6 E,T3 C,T7 E,T4 C,T8 P2 | C,T5 E,T1 C,T6 E,T2 C,T7 E,T3 C,T8 E,T4 P3 | E,T5 C,T1 E,T6 C,T2 E,T7 C,T3 E,T8 C,T4 P4 | C,T1 E,T5 C,T2 E,T6 C,T3 E,T7 C,T4 E,T8 Note that this matrix consists of the following 2x2 subdesign: E C C E This 2x2 design is a latin square design. It has the property that the "treatment effect", here E-C, the control-adjusted response, can be estimated free and clear of the main (additive) effects of participant and topic. Here, participant and topic are treated statistically as blocking factors. This means that even in the presence of differences between participants and topics, which clearly are anticipated, the design will provide estimates of E-C that are not contaminated by these differences. However, the estimate of E-C is contaminated by the presence of an interaction between topic and participant. Therefore, we replicate the 2x2 latin square 4x4 times to get the minimal 8x8 design for each site. The contaminating effect of the topic by participant interaction is reduced by averaging the sixteen estimates of E-C that are available, one for each 2x2 latin square. This is analogous to averaging replicate measurements of a single quantity in order to reduce the measurement uncertainty. 2. Augmentation The design for a given site can be augmented in two ways: 1. Participants can be added by in groups of 4 using the design for P1-4 (above). 2. Systems can be added by repeating the 8x8 design with at least one new system. Topics cannot be added/subtracted individually for each site. All augmentations other than the two listed above, however interesting, are outside the scope of this design. If sites plan such adjunct experiments, they are encouraged to design them for maximal synergy with the track design. 3. Analysis Up to each group, but all are strongly encouraged to take advantage of the experimental design and undertake: 1. exploratory data analysis to examine the patterns of correlation, interaction, etc. involving the major factors. Some example plots for the TREC-6 interactive data (recall or precision by searcher or topic) are available on the Interactive Track web site at www-nlpir.nist.gov/~over/t7i under "Interactive Track History". 2. analysis of variance (ANOVA), where appropriate, to estimate the separate contributions of searcher, topic and system as a first step in understanding why the results of one search are different from those of another.

Hubble celebrates 15th anniversary with spectacular new images
  Whirlpool Galaxy M51
  25 April 2005
In the 15 years that the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope has orbited Earth, it has taken three-quarters of a million photographs of the cosmos. Two new views have been released of Hubble's most well-known images: the Whirlpool Galaxy, M51, and the Eagle Nebula, M16.   The new images released for Hubble’s 15th anniversary are among the largest and sharpest views Hubble has ever taken, and were made with Hubble's Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS). The new Whirlpool Galaxy image shows the spiral galaxy's classic features, from its curving arms, where newborn stars reside, to its yellowish central core that serves as home for older stars. The new Eagle Nebula image reveals a tall, dense tower of gas being sculpted by ultraviolet light from a group of massive, hot stars. NASA’s Space Shuttle Discovery launched Hubble into space on 24 April 1990 and placed it into orbit a day after, thereby opening a brand new era in astronomy. For the first time ever, a large telescope that viewed in visible light orbited above Earth's distorting atmosphere, which blurs starlight and make images appear fuzzy. After installation of a new camera and a device that compensated for an improperly ground mirror, images of planets, stars, galaxies, and nebula began pouring in – all up to 10 times sharper than any previous telescope had ever delivered.     Long list of scientific achievements
  During 15 years of viewing the sky, Hubble has taken more than 700000 exposures of more than 22 000 celestial objects. The spacecraft itself has whirled around Earth nearly 88 000 times, travelling more than 4000 million kilometres. The orbiting observatory generates enough data every day - about 15 gigabytes - to fill more than three DVDs, and in total it has produced 23 terabytes of data, equal to the amount of text in 23 million novels. Over 3900 astronomers from all over the world have used the telescope, and compiled a long list of scientific achievements, published in more than 4000 papers, such as: - calculating the precise age of the Universe to be 13 700 million years old); - confirming the existence of a strange form of energy called dark energy; - detecting small ‘proto-galaxies’ that emitted their light when the Universe was less than a 1000 million years old; - proving the existence of ‘super-massive black holes’; - seeing a comet hitting Jupiter; and - showing that the process of forming planetary systems is common throughout the galaxy.     The Whirlpool Galaxy
  The two winding arms of the majestic Whirlpool spiral galaxy M51 (NGC 5194) are actually long lanes of stars and gas laced with dust, a hallmark of so-called ‘grand-design’ spiral galaxies. Located 31 million light-years away in the constellation Canes Venatici (the Hunting Dogs), the Whirlpool's face-on view and closeness to Earth allow astronomers to study a classic spiral galaxy's structure and star-forming processes. Some astronomers believe that the Whirlpool's arms are so prominent because of the effects of a close encounter with NGC 5195, the small, yellowish galaxy at the outermost tip of one of the Whirlpool's arms. At first glance, the compact galaxy appears to be tugging on the arm. Hubble's clear view, however, shows that NGC 5195 is passing behind the Whirlpool. The small galaxy has been gliding past the Whirlpool for hundreds of millions of years.     Eagle Nebula M16
The Eagle Nebula
  A soaring tower of cold gas and dust about 9.5 light-years high, which is twice the distance from the Sun to our nearest star, rises from a stellar nursery called the Eagle Nebula, M16. Inside the gaseous tower, stars may be forming. Some of the stars may have been created by dense gas collapsing under gravity. Other stars may be forming due to pressure from gas that has been heated by the neighbouring hot stars. The tower's rough surface is illuminated by starlight and is silhouetted against the background glow of more distant gas. The colours in this image were produced by gas energised by the star cluster's powerful ultraviolet light. The blue colour at the top is from glowing oxygen and the red in the lower region is from glowing hydrogen.     Send this page to a friend       More about...

Hubble and the Messier objects
The Hubble Space Telescope and the Messier objects [hst.jpg]
The famous Hubble Space Telescope is certainly one of the most innovative tools of the astronomers in the 1990s decade; the present author is just now going to predict (and is convinced it deserves) that it might win the title "Photographer of the Decade" for the 1990, as Voyager 2 was nominated for the 1980. Its most spectacular results, together with an open and intelligent public relations policy of the Space Telescope Science Institute, has provided astronomers with a great flood of data and high-quality images, and an outstanding popularity, especially as all the materials get public domain two years after they were obtained. The Hubble results have revolutionized the state of knowledge in virtually any branch of astronomy -- not that every good result comes from the HST, but as these data are available publicly, they are used if ever possible; from planets, comets, and asteroids to stars, clusters, nebulae, and galaxies, every sort of objects in the sky were investigated, often obtaining most revolutionary results. Among the most outstanding achievements are observations of objects from Messier's catalog, as those are outstanding representatives of all types of Deep-Sky objects. Because not every author has made his results available to the public domain, we cannot present a comprehensive review here at the moment. But we have tried to link into our catalog some of the most interesting achievements. There's but one fact on the Hubble Telescope's optics which must be kept in mind: The Hubble telescope has a very long focal length of 190 feet (58 m), and thus a one degree field measures one full meter in the space telescope's focal plane, and one arc minute about 1.7 cm. As its detectors are very much smaller, their fields of view are actually small, so that only photos of small portions of extended objects like most of Messier's catalog can be obtained. Moreover, the Hubble Space Telescope is not only an astronomical instrument (though the telescope makes up its biggest part) but also a sophisticated spacecraft. As a spacecraft, it has proven to be very reliable, and was so well operated that the technological operations did virtually never concern the scientific program (at least up to November 1999 when it shut down itself because the fourth of 6 gyroscopes failed - only to be recovered in the third servicing mission, STS-103, in December 1999). The Hubble Space Telescope (HST) was originally projected under the name "Large Space Telescope" (LST) and then simply "Space Telescope" (ST), and developed since the 1970s. Indeed, Hubble is one of the more important in a considerably long list of orbiting telescopes, or astronomy satellites. It is the second of four in a NASA series of large orbiting observatories, observing in the visible light, together with the Compton Gamma Ray Telescope (CGRO) observing in Gamma-ray light, the Chandra X-ray Observatory (CXO), and the Spitzer Space Telescope (SST)
observing in Infrared. Here's a list of links to the Hubble observations of Messier objects we could collect with our pages: M1: Jeff Hester
and Paul Scowen
of the Arizona State University, Tempe, Arizona, have obtained gorgeous images of the Crab Nebula
with the Hubble Space Telescope. These images have been reproduced previously in Sky and Telescope

have been extracted, which are e.g. suitable for computer screen background. On May 30, 1996, new studies
of the same authors have provided some new insight into the dynamics and changes of the Crab nebula and its pulsar. Studies of June 2000

M100: This grand-design spiral was among the first objects photographed after the HST refurbishment
by the crew of the Shutle mission STS-61 in December 1993. Moreover, this galaxy is the home of the first Cepheid variables discovered in the Virgo cluster of galaxies, giving a distance of 50-60 million light years, and a Hubble constant of 80+/-17. However, with the refinement of the distance scale by ESA's astrometric Hipparcos satellite, this value must be refined by about 10 percent, and current estimates for H0 are closer to 67+/-7. M104: Hubble Mosaic of the Majestic Sombrero Galaxy. M105: Central Massive Dark Object
(Jan 1997) We know of more good Hubble results concerning Messier objects. They are listed below, and we would like to get images and more information for inclusion here: M95
was a target within the key project of searching for Cepheid variables in neighboring galaxies. We are still looking for Hubble images of this galaxy though. M101: The distance of M101 has been determined as 24 million light years (27 if corrected for Hipparcos data), again with Cepheids. A HST image of M101 was in a semi-recent issue of Astronomy magazine. Also, there were older images which are not yet on SEDS, e.g. in the slide sets of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific, including more photos of M42, M77, M87, and others which still await being included here. Some Hubble images of non-Messier objects have also found their way into our service: NGC 2903

SPACE WIRE Hubble Space Telescope turns 15, with a galaxy of achievements WASHINGTON (AFP) Apr 26, 2005 The Hubble Space Telescope turned 15 Monday, with 750,000 photographs of deep space and Earth to its credit, but its future is now uncertain. Hubble was launched by the Space Shuttle Discovery on April 25, 1990, and opened a new era in astronomy. However, the telescope, a cooperative effort of NASA and the European Space Agency, would not be operational until three years later. A mirror that had been improperly ground was corrected in 1993, when a new camera was also installed in the first repair mission by a space shuttle. Once repaired, the telescope beamed back photographs 10 times sharper than ever before of galaxies, supernovas, giant explosions marking the death of a star and the birth of a black hole. Thanks to Hubble, flying above the atmospheric distortion that hinders even more powerful Earth-based telescopes, scientists have been able to confirm that the universe is rapidly expanding and to calculate precisely its age, at 13.7 billion years, according to NASA. Among other achievements, Hubble's observations allowed scientists to confirm the existence of a strange form of energy called dark energy; proved the existence of super-massive black holes; provided sharp views of a comet hitting Jupiter; and showed that the process of forming planetary systems is common throughout the galaxy, NASA said in a statement. NASA has so far decided not to send a shuttle to repair the aging Hubble, citing the 450 million dollars it would cost to do so. But the space agency's new chief, Michael Griffin, has said he would revisit the decision. Astronauts have serviced Hubble four times, and many scientists hoped that a fifth service mission would be funded to enable Hubble to function to 2011, when its infrared replacement, the James Webb Space Telescope, is scheduled to arrive. Currently, it is believed that Hubble's aging solar cells will provide enough energy to survive to 2007. All rights reserved. © 2005 Agence France-Presse.

By Leonard David, SPACE.com A White House decision to cut funding for a Hubble Space Telescope servicing mission and dump the observatory into a remote stretch of ocean waters at a future date is sure to incite debate in scientific, engineering, and policy making circles. The Hubble Space Telescope snaps a view of Senegal. The telescope is in need of service, which is not in the current NASA budget.
NASA/JSC
Intensive work has been underway at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center to develop telerobotic servicing skills for the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) in the event that a space shuttle crew is never again sent to the orbiting facility. Aerospace firms in the United States and in Canada have teamed with NASA to develop a Hubble Robotic Vehicle Deorbit Module. Either a robotic or shuttle-based servicing option reportedly would cost in excess of $1 billion. That pricetag is viewed by the White House, according to sources, as not affordable given other high-priority and more expensive efforts, such as the return-to-flight of the space shuttle program, as well as moving forward on NASA's Moon, Mars and beyond agenda. White House plans to scuttle Hubble is part of NASA's 2006 budget request, sources said, with some money in the budget allocated to using a propulsion module coupled to Hubble for its safe but destructive deorbiting. The cutting of the HST servicing mission from NASA's 2006 budget request was first reported by Space News on its Web site Friday and on SPACE.com. Leading the fight
Senator Barbara Mikulski (D-Md.), a fervent Hubble supporter whose state is home to both the Goddard Space Flight Center and the Space Telescope Science Institute, issued a statement late January 21 in which she vowed to continue advocating an HST servicing mission. "It is essential that we have a safe and reliable servicing mission to Hubble," Mikulski said, that is consistent with the findings of the Columbia Accident Investigation Board and last month's findings of a National Academy of Sciences (NAS) panel on the Hubble issue. On December 8, in the NAS final report released by the Committee on the Assessment of Options for Extending the Life of the Hubble Space Telescope, a blue ribbon group of experts said that NASA should reinstate a space shuttle mission to refurbish the Earth-orbiting telescope. "I led the fight to add $300 million to NASA's budget last year for a Hubble servicing mission, and I plan to lead the fight again this year. This is what the American people expect and deserve," Mikulski said in a statement. In defense of Hubble
Response to the White House decision has engendered a wait-and-see attitude in some astronomical quarters, while others have been quick to react. Hubble's best days lie ahead, predicted John Bahcall, a professor of natural sciences at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey. In 1998, he was a recipient of the National Medal of Science for his pioneering efforts in neutrino astrophysics and his contributions to the development and planning of the Hubble Space Telescope. "President Nixon cancelled in 1973 the Hubble Telescope while it was still in the development phase. The reason was similar: other activities in the NASA budget took priority," Bahcall told SPACE.com. "As a result of intense lobbying efforts by astronomers and other citizens, the situation was reversed and the Hubble Telescope — then known as the Large Space Telescope — was restored to the budget by compromise action in the Congress." Bahcall said that Hubble has contributed enormously to scientific knowledge and to America's respect abroad. The telescope represents achievements of which all Americans can be proud, he said. "I am confident that Americans of all walks of life will come to the defense of the Hubble and cause the Congress to restore the repair of the telescope to the NASA budget," Bahcall said. Telerobotic progress
Excellent progress is being made on a telerobotic approach to servicing the Hubble, said Jim Crocker, vice president of civil space at Lockheed Martin Space Systems of Denver. The firm has supported NASA's planning and then repair and servicing of the HST via four space shuttle missions to date. The telerobotics team at work at Goddard Space Flight Center "have a good shot at pulling this off," Crocker told SPACE.com the day before the Space News story on the White House HST decision appeared. Lockheed Martin's role in the rocket-launched Hubble Robotic Vehicle Deorbit Module (HRVDM), Crocker said, is providing all the sensors to do the rendezvous and docking with the Hubble, as well as provide the liquid-fueled propellant module that would later deorbit the telescope. For their part, Canada's MacDonald, Dettwiler and Associates (MDA) Ltd. — through its MD Robotics group in Brampton, Ontario — is providing the Dextre robot that's part of the HRVDM. It is being specially configured to replace batteries, gyroscopes, and perhaps an instrument on the HST to extend its life. NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center is overseeing and integrating the HRVDM work. Crocker said that simulations performed at NASA's Goddard Space Flight center have converted doubters, including him, that performing many of the scheduled Hubble servicing tasks through the tender loving care of telerobotics is feasible. "That's not to say it's not challenging," Crocker said, "but the team is making a convincing story." Rabbit out of the hat
There's also good news to report in keeping Hubble in an operating mode. Worry centers on HST's gyroscopes, batteries, or other gear that might fail early, negating the observatory's useful lifetime. "The team continues to pull rabbits out of the hat," Crocker said. For instance, a two gyro science mode, along with the needed software has been worked out. HST's original design had to have three gyros working to do science. Additionally, a new battery management approach is being adopted. "That's good news," Crocker said. "I'm hearing we're likely to be able to get [HST] into 2008 now." At the end of the day, Crocker concluded, whatever option is decided upon for Hubble servicing and its ultimate reentry, "everyone on the team wants the best chance of success possible."

The Hubble Space Telescope
by Jim Slotta Scientist
Telescopes have come a long way since the days of Galileo! Over the years, larger and larger telescopes were constructed in order to capture the light from more and more distant stars. Still, no matter how large a lens or mirror was used, there was always a problem with any telescope located on the surface of the earth, as the earth's atmosphere tends to block or absorb some of the starlight. Because the light from distant stars is very faint to begin with, this interference from the atmosphere became a serious problem as scientists looked further and further out into space. For decades, astronomers longed for a telescope that was free from the earth's atmospheric blockade -- on the surface of the moon, perhaps, or in orbit around the earth as a satellite. In 1993, they were finally rewarded, as NASA engineers delivered the orbiting Hubble Space Telescope: (Medium, 57K)
Originally, the giant light-collecting mirror of the Hubble was slightly out of shape, which meant that the images of far-off stars were out of focus. But when space shuttle astronauts repaired this problem in December of 1993, a whole new chapter in the book of astronomy had begun. One newspaper reporter wrote: "The Hubble Space Telescope, once blurry and the butt of jokes, has been repaired, making it sharp enough to see two fireflies 10 feet apart in Tokyo from Washington DC. It is sensitive enough to detect their individual flashes." --The San Fransisco Examiner
The Hubble can look at galaxies which are very old as described in an article from Philadelphia's daily newspaper, the Philadelphia Inquirer.: "...scientists announced they had pictures of galaxies so distant that the light from them had taken billions of years to reach Hubble's cameras. The telescope was therefore seeing how the galaxies looked when they were young-it was watching the past unfold." --The Philadelphia Inquirer
(Check out the Philadelphia Inquirer article to learn all about the Hubble telescope, including some of its major successes as a scientific instrument.) Evidence Information KEYWORDS Telescope, Hubble, Light, Space, Astronomy SUBMITTER Philip Bell Additional Information METHODS The evidence combines NASA photos of the Hubble with a quote from a newspaper and an informative article about the Hubble telescope's history and various achievements. This informative article, written by a Philadelphia Inquirer reporter, contains some interesting links to other related Web sites. INSPIRATION This evidence about the Hubble Space Telescope was assembled in order to provide some information about the problems with conventional telescopes and how they have been overcome. PROJECTS How Far Does Light Go? GUIDANCE - Why does the fact that the Hubble is outside of the Earth's atmosphere make a difference in what it allows us to see? - Does the fact that the Hubble can see light from galaxies which has traveled in space for billions of years support either theory in the debate? - How far away can the Hubble see stars? What does that say about the light coming from these stars? - The article tells us that the Hubble has allowed astronomers to learn more about distant galaxies. Why does it say the Hubble was seeing the galaxies as they appeared when they were very young? - Could a telescope on the earth's surface with a really huge and precise mirror or lens detect the things the Hubble is detecting? Why or why not? COMPREHENSION TIME 5 to 20 minutes SCIENCE LEVEL Middle School and Above KIE Evidence. Copyright © 1996-7 The KIE Group.

Insurance Group Names Most Dangerous Vehicles 03.16.2005
By James M. Flammang
According to the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety
(IIHS), a version of the Chevrolet Blazer
may be the most unsafe vehicle to be found on American roads. Based on the Institute's study of 1999-2002 passenger vehicles, the two-door, two-wheel-drive Blazer had the highest rate of driver deaths, in both single-vehicle and multiple-vehicle accidents. While the average annual driver death rate was 87 per million registered vehicles, the two-door Blazer averaged 308 deaths per million. Rollover accidents also topped the list of 199 vehicle models, at 251 per million. Models with the highest death rates are "mostly small cars and mid-sized SUVs," the Institute asserted. The list of vehicles with high rates also included the Mitsubishi Mirage
two-door sedan, with 209 driver deaths per million vehicles, followed by the Pontiac Firebird, subcompact Kia Rio, and first-generation Kia Sportage
with two-wheel drive. Several sport-utility vehicles showed low rates. Judged by IIHS results, the safest vehicle of all could be the Mercedes-Benz E-Class
sedan, with a driver death rate of 10 per million. Next came the Toyota 4Runner
midsize SUV, Volkswagen Passat
sedan, and Lexus RX 300
(another midsize SUV). Also on the list vehicles with low death rates was the Toyota RAV4, which is a compact sport-utility vehicle. Several of the models with high driver death rates have already ceased production, and the Blazer is being phased out of Chevrolet's lineup. Kia now markets a completely different Sportage model. General Motors responded to the IIHS report by stating that the Blazer was properly tested while in production. GM also questions "what role driver behavior, such as drunk driving and driving without a safety belt, played in these deaths." Trucks, according to a GM statement, are driven more than cars, "often on secondary roads where more rollover crashes occur." The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, which conducts crash tests and engages in safety research, is affiliated with the insurance industry.

Why Do You Hate the SUV?
Date Posted 11-01-2002 This month's topic comes courtesy of the September 16, 2002, issue of Automotive News
(with a follow-up story covering the same topic in the October 7 issue). Before getting into the meat of my discussion, I think it bears mentioning that, despite the title, Automotive News
is not a 100-percent, over-the-top, prays-to-the-gods-of-internal-combustion, pro-automotive periodical. This publication, which arrives in my mailbox every Monday morning, generally does an adequate job of presenting both sides of any given topic related to the industry in which I work. However, after reading the "Chorus of SUV critics grows louder" story in the September 16 issue, and then the "Author bases anti-SUV conclusions on statistics" article from the October 7 issue, I felt it was time to address this latest anti-SUV tirade. As someone who finds plenty wrong with the current SUV situation, as chronicled in my column last March, you SUV haters can rest easy knowing I'm never going to defend any of the hypocrites who buy an SUV when they don't need one. What I am going to defend is every American's right to buy an SUV if he wants to, whether he needs it or not.
In both of the Automotive News
stories I've referenced above a gentleman named Keith Bradsher is cited as leading the charge to educate consumers about the real dangers of SUVs. Mr. Bradsher's book, High and Mighty ? SUVs: The World's Most Dangerous Vehicles and How They Got That Way
has an interesting title, though I wonder if "High and Mighty" refers to SUVs or the liberal intelligentsia that often goes around this country trying to "protect us from ourselves for our own good." In this case, I'm inclined to believe the latter simply because Mr. Bradsher partakes of the exact same type of double-talk he claims to be fighting against. Specifically, Mr. Bradsher takes issue with how the automakers paint SUVs as safe, rugged off-road vehicles capable of providing fun and adventure to their owners, even though most of those owners will never go off-road. He thinks the poor American consumer is being duped into buying SUVs by the big, mean automakers that are only interested in making a profit off of these rolling death traps that use too much gas. According to the October 7 issue of Automotive News, Bradsher thinks automakers "manipulate automotive journalists by setting up press events for sport-utilities in exotic off-road locations when they know the vehicle won't be driven that way." It further states "this distracts reviewers from evaluating the vehicles where most people drive them." Wow, and I always thought my staff did a pretty good job of identifying how even the most capable off-road vehicles will rarely be driven off-road by the average owner. Now I learn that my entire editorial team has been carefully "manipulated" by those dastardly automakers. (Can you hear the "protecting us from ourselves" overtones yet?) Thankfully, we all have someone like Mr. Bradsher to shine the light of truth on this otherwise dark and sinister plot, right? Well, not really. When Bradsher says that SUVs use more gas than other types of vehicles, he's generally correct, although many compact, and even some midsize SUVs, can get better mileage than midsize and larger sedans. But where Bradsher clearly crosses the line into deceitful reporting is his assertions that SUVs are inherently dangerous. Indeed, the title of his book calls them "The World's Most Dangerous Vehicles." If you're hearing echoes of Ralph Nader's exuberantly alarmist Unsafe at Any Speed
book from 40 years ago, you're on the right track. To justify his branding of SUVs as the modern-day Corvair, Bradsher points to accident and injury rates that show SUVs being involved in more crashes than full-size sedans or minivans. He specifically cited this point in an interview on Fox's "The O'Reilly Factor" with Bill O'Reilly. But as anyone with basic PR training knows, you can make statistics say whatever you want them to. Saying that SUVs are more dangerous than full-size sedans simply because they are involved in more accidents is like saying people who fly on airplanes are more likely to die in an air disaster when compared to people who never fly. That statement may seem overly simplistic but, remember, people on the ground occasionally die in air disasters, too. The point is that the nature of the driver (just like the nature of people who do or don't fly) is critically important in both arguments. To put it another way, look at the type of people who drive full-size sedans and minivans. In case you don't already know, full-sedans, like the Ford Crown Victoria, Buick Regal or Toyota Avalon, tend to be driven by people over 50. And minivans tend to be driven by parents transporting children (increasingly, minivans are also being driven by people over 50 who have discovered how convenient those huge sliding doors are when it comes time to get in and out of the vehicle ? my in-laws and their Oldsmobile Silhouette being a perfect example). SUVs, on the other hand, tend to be driven by young people, and they often serve as a sort of rolling party because they can carry many bodies (like a minivan) and they have a cool image (pretty much the opposite of a minivan). Yes, lots of housewives have traded in their minivans for an SUV in recent years. But minivans accounted for just over one million in U.S. sales last year, while SUVs accounted for nearly four million. Obviously, it's not just suburban moms who buy these high-profile vehicles. So you have grandparents and parents almost exclusively driving large sedans and minivans, while over in SUV land you have plenty of young, single people carrying all their friends to and from the latest social gathering. And, lo and behold, SUVs have a higher accident rate and injury rate than large sedans and minivans. Bradsher seems to have left this minor point out of his various media interviews. I'd hate to suggest he's using deceptive tactics to make a point and sell a product (sort of like touting the off-road prowess of certain vehicles that will likely never go off-road) but, oh, what the hell, I'm gonna say it anyway. And I'll present this counter argument to Bradsher: If you take two equally skilled, competent and intelligent drivers, and put one in a Lincoln Navigator and the other in a Lincoln LS, the driver in the Navigator is less likely to suffer serious injuries from a traffic accident. Keep in mind that competent and intelligent drivers always wear their seatbelt and understand that SUVs don't handle like a sports car. Or try this one on for size: You have just been told by the Great Spirit that in the next seven days you will be involved in a serious traffic accident. You don't know where, you don't know when, and you don't know the specific nature of the crash, but it will happen. The only factor you can control is what vehicle you will be driving for the next week ? Cadillac Escalade, Honda Odyssey or Toyota Avalon. Which one do you pick, Mr. Bradsher? Keep in mind that the two vehicles you don't
pick will also be involved in the accident. If Bradsher wants to make an argument that it's easier for bad drivers to crash in an SUV than in a minivan, I might actually go along with that argument. But that doesn't make the SUV "the world's most dangerous vehicle," it simply proves what we already knew: even a large, heavy vehicle can't save lousy drivers from themselves. Another point Bradsher fails to mention is the increasingly carlike nature of SUVs. In the last two years, Ford's best-selling SUVs, the Explorer and Expedition, went from riding on a solid rear axle to utilizing an independent rear suspension. This move greatly increased the stability of both vehicles. How do we know this? Well, beyond simple logic and some instrumented testing under controlled conditions, one of our editors recently had to perform a rapid lane change maneuver in our long-term Explorer
after an accident happened right in front of him on a Los Angeles freeway. He swerved hard left and then hard right, recreating the exact driving style that had previous Ford Explorers going rubber side up. In this instance, the 2002 Explorer remained stable and composed. Once again, not bad for being one of "the world's most dangerous vehicles," huh? I'll concede Bradsher's point that most SUV owners never go off-road, and I agree with him that automakers (especially domestic automakers) have more to gain by selling high-priced, high-profit SUVs instead of lower-priced cars. But, as is usually the case, market forces are addressing these issues. Today's SUV buyers demand a more refined and stable vehicle. Foreign automakers were the first ones to offer carlike SUVs, but the domestic manufacturers are quickly catching up (with models like the redesigned Explorer and Expedition). As for vehicle emissions and gas mileage, SUVs are making rapid advances in both areas as well. Honda's new Pilot already has ULEV (ultra low emissions vehicle) certification, and it gets 17/22 miles-per-gallon in city/highway driving (numbers not far behind the minivans and full-size sedans Bradsher has such an affinity for). What Bradsher and the rest of this country's SUV haters need to realize is that the genie is out of the bottle. Fifteen years ago most Americans didn't know what an SUV was, and they certainly didn't realize the kind of people-/cargo-carrying capacity such vehicles offered. They also didn't know how reassuring it feels to sit high above the road surface. Now every American over the age of 10 has either driven or ridden in an SUV, and while most may not like the tippy handling or harsh ride over broken pavement, they love the "king of the road" sensation and versatile seating/cargo options. They also like knowing that, if they wanted to, they could scamper away from the beaten path for an off-road adventure. Unlike Mr. Frost, most will never actually take that road less traveled, but we Americans like having our options open. Once again, I want to emphasize that SUVs are not for everyone, and, like any good American, I don't support single, city-dwelling, white-collar professionals, especially ones that rarely carry more than a briefcase or purse and never go off-road, buying seven-passenger vehicles that get less than 20 mpg. However, my reasoning relates to efficiency and geopolitical circumstances (it'd be good not to further grow our dependence on imported oil). However, I'm not going to sell the public a bunch of misinformation about SUVs being inherently unsafe because, well, they aren't. I also don't appreciate all the hypocritical Hollywood "environmentalists" who claim allegiance to Mother Earth?from the cockpits of their Range Rovers, Navigators and Hummer H2s. Of course, regardless of my or Bradsher's desire to see fewer SUVs on the road, the truth is that these vehicles are not going away. They will undoubtedly continue to get even safer, more refined and more fuel-efficient, but they will never disappear from the American landscape. If that thought bothers you, well, now you know how I've felt for the past two decades about rap music. Rather ironic, actually, when you consider the growing bond between certain SUVs and rap music. But hey, at least SUVs will be getting more
refined as the years pass.

Blazer Most Dangerous Vehicle, Insurance Study Finds March 15, 2005
The Mercedes E-Class sedan is the safest car on the highway, while the least safe is the two-door Chevrolet Blazer, according to a study by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS). The institute reached its conclusions about the Mercedes, Blazer and 197 other relatively popular vehicles by studying driver death rates of 1999 to 2002 model cars and trucks from 2000 to 2003. Among four-door midsize cars, the Volkswagen Passat performed best, with an average of 16 driver deaths per million registered vehicles annually, but the Chrysler Sebring had 126 driver deaths. Among midsize sport utility vehicles with four-wheel drive, the Toyota 4Runner had 12 deaths per million registered vehicles annually, compared with 134 for the two-door Ford Explorer. The study focused on the rate of driver deaths in various types of crashes, including both single- and multiple-vehicle accidents. The overall driver death rate, for 199 models studied during the 2000-2003 calendar years, was 87 per million registered vehicles annually, the institute said. The Blazer had an average of 308 driver deaths per million. It also had the highest rate of driver deaths in rollover accidents at 251 per million. "Large cars and minivans dominate among vehicle models with very low death rates" while those with the highest fatality rates are "mostly small cars and small and midsize SUVs," the study said The Results Lowest Rates of Driver Death

Why an SUV is now the most dangerous vehicle in Iraq
Patrick Graham in Baghdad Sunday April 4, 2004 The Observer
It has become clear in the past few years that four-wheel-drive SUVs are some of the most dangerous vehicles on the road. Nowhere is this more true than in Iraq. In almost every deadly attack on foreign civilians, the victims have been in Sport Utility Vehicles, almost invariably white: the occupation car of choice. The burning wreckage in Falluja last week was unmistakable. The charred bodies of the four Americans were scattered around two white SUVs. The men - Scott Helvenston, from Florida, a producer of extreme fitness videos; Jerry Zovko from Ohio; Wesley Batalona, 48, from Hawaii; and wrestling coach Michael Teague, 38, from Tennessee - were former US special forces members now working for Blackwater, a private security firm that protects Paul Bremer, the coalition's administrator. Falluja is a centre of the anti-American resistance, where even the police don't support the Americans. US soldiers don't drive through Falluja much. When they do, they have helicopter back-up and heavy armour. 'Almost every foreigner who has been killed here is an idiot,' said one ex-Navy SEAL. Soldiers often show little sympathy for those who fail to follow the right procedure. He began listing their mistakes. To start with, they were in Falluja, in an SUV. Next, he guessed they had gone through the city before and had met no problems, but were seen leaving an American base - a routine can kill you. Later, they were followed. 'People don't realise that this is war,' he said. But last week's horrific scenes in Falluja give the wrong impression. Iraq is, in fact, a lot safer than it was last summer. There is less violence now but it is better organised, more methodical. Especially in the capital. You can tell a lot about the security situation in Baghdad by listening to the city. Last summer, there was almost constant gunfire. The city was in chaos and murders and robbery were common. Today, there are police on the streets and it is much safer. The problem is that, while the police presence reduces some kinds of crime, there is nobody in control of the city. For a careful criminal, there are no consequences. The other day, we drove by a café in which gangsters hang out. If someone wants to kill you, this is where they can go. It costs $100 to have someone shot. The killers know they will never be caught. For all the media reports about foreign deaths, life is far more dangerous for Iraqis, especially Iraqis who work for foreigners. And while three journalists have been killed in the past month, they have all been killed by the American army. And they were Arab or Iraqi. This is what Iraqis complain about when they say ' maku amin ', no security. If you anger somebody, he can kill you with impunity. A foreign newspaper bureau here recently tried to fire one of its guards for sleeping on the job. A driver quietly explained that, if the guard were fired, he would hire someone to take revenge. The guard stayed. If you can't threaten someone with a vendetta, then you have very little leverage in negotiations. As a result, the tribeless Christian community has been one of the worst hit by kidnappers. In Baghdad, we listen to bombs exploding rather than chaotic gunfire. One woke us up last week, rattling the windows, blowing in the curtains. Five Iraqis were killed. What were they driving? An SUV. ·
Two attacks on Iraqi police south of Baghdad yesterday left four dead, bringing to 350 the number of policemen killed by shooting and suicide bombings in the past year. Special report

“WHAT WOULD SATAN DRIVE?” AND OTHER UNFAIR QUESTIONS ABOUT SUVs The SUV Problem—Hating Them is Too Simplistic
Given a choice, we suspect that Satan would enjoy driving any vehicle with a Burst Into Flames feature. In any event, should today's SUV drivers be condemned to Dante's 7th circle of Hell (the one known as "Yugo")? SUV bashing has become a popular sport among some. SUVs typically get poor gas mileage, they pollute more than cars, they're more [picture of pristine mountain lake]
dangerous in crashes (both for their occupants and especially for drivers of other vehicles). All these things are true. But in some ways, it is too simplistic to say that SUVs are bad and cars are good. For instance, how many of us are driving the most fuel-efficient, least polluting vehicle available on the market? In addition, other factors—such as how far we choose to commute to work, whether or not we carpool, whether or not we combine trips for errands, whether we're still driving a 15-year-old "blue smoker"—all play a role in determining our personal "driving impact" on the environment. If environmental impact is evaluated for all drivers, SUV owners are likely to score more poorly because of the gas-mileage deficit of the typical SUV as compared to a car. Don't forget, though—some SUVs get better gas mileage than some cars. In the 2004 fuel economy guide released by the US EPA and DOE, the Toyota RAV4 had the highest fuel economy in the SUV category, getting 24 mpg, whereas the best of the large cars, the Chevrolet Malibu, got only 22 mpg. The 2004 vehicle with the worst gas mileage was a car—the Lamborghini L-147, which got only 9 mpg. What??? Is Grinning Planet giving a free pass to purchasers of 6,000-pound gas-guzzling behemoths and other SUVs? No way. Most purchasers of such vehicles don't actually NEED them, and putting status, ego, or macho-ness—or, even worse, exploitation of a tax loophole—above reduction of pollution and imported oil use does indeed deserve scorn. But even if the front part of the Line of People Whose Vehicles and Driving Habits Need Improving is predominantly SUV drivers, all of us can ask ourselves [picture of pristine mountain lake]
whether we can do more to reduce gasoline usage and pollution by purchasing a more environmentally friendly vehicle or developing greener driving habits. And now, for the REAL villains in this debate; those old stand-bys we all love to jab at: Congress and the White House. And we don't just mean the current Congress and White House. For the last dozen years, our elected leaders, in concert with our never-admit-anything-can-be-improved auto manufacturers, have squashed attempts to significantly raise fuel economy standards. This is particularly irksome when it comes to SUVs, since they are driven like cars but are not held to the same gas-mileage standards as cars. We payers-at-the-pump and breathers-of-the-air should be outraged that fuel economy standards have not risen significantly for both SUVs AND cars. It's shameful that the average vehicle today gets worse gas mileage than the average vehicle in 1980. The argument that SUVs and minivans will be unaffordable or unmanufacturable if they are made more fuel efficient is the same sort of gloom-and-doom scaremongering that manufacturers put forth in the 1970s when fuel-economy and pollution standards were first proposed. Car makers CAN apply such measures to SUVs and minivans, and they should. The Union of Concerned Scientists recently designed two SUVs that were safer and more fuel efficient than today's models—without sacrificing size or performance. (See the UCS report here)
Whether you're an anti-SUV crusader who calls them "F-U Vs" or you're an SUV owner who drives one with pride, we should be able to agree that keeping reasonable style and performance choices in the vehicle fleet and making all vehicles safer, more fuel-efficient, and less polluting are both worthwhile and compatible goals. Publish date: 11-DEC-2003
BRAIN FOOD It is worth noting that although the Toyota RAV4 has slightly better gasoline costs and lower carbon dioxide emissions than the Chevrolet Malibu, it gets worse ratings for emissions of carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, and hydrocarbons.   You can get Grinning Planet free via email each week

  High and Mighty: SUVs—The World's Most Dangerous Vehicles and How They Got That Way
by Keith Bradsher (Non-Fiction)   DESCRIPTION Just what is it that some people hate so much about SUVs? For Keith Bradsher, it's a number of things; but let's start with their gas-guzzling obesity, their higher pollution levels, and their poor safety ratings on the road. Bradsher is also critical of the devious way Detroit has marketed SUVs and slipped them past many of the regulations that apply to "the rest of us," and he's non-too-happy about how our politicians and regulators have let it happen. But this book is not just a rant—it uses facts to make the case. You'll have to read it for yourself to decide whether SUVs really are the world's most dangerous vehicles.

  PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENT   Hey, we don't pick the Google ads!   – GP     "Even though cars get worse gas mileage than two decades ago, they actually have become much more efficient. The problem is that the efficiency went into more power and larger, heavier vehicles, not into fuel economy. If all of the technological efficiency improvements had gone into efficiency, miles per gallon would be significantly higher than they are today." — Neal Elliott, American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy

Motorcycles Remain Most Dangerous Vehicles NHTSA Announces Discretionary Cooperative Agreements For Research Under The Crash Injury Research And Engineering Network (CIREN) HRSA To Update State-By-State Self Assessments Of Trauma Care Systems CMS Announces Improved Efforts To Reduce Medicare Payment Error Rates
Motorcycles Remain Most Dangerous Vehicles
While travel by motor vehicle has become steadily safer in the United States, motorcycles remain the most dangerous type of motor vehicle to drive. Motorcyclists are involved in fatal crashes at a rate of 35.0 per 100 million miles of travel compared with a rate of 1.7 per 100 million miles of travel in cars. This study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) examined the association between alcohol impairment and fatal motorcycle crashes. Over the time period 1983 to 2003, the rate of fatal motorcycle crashes among alcohol-impaired drivers declined for drivers under 40 and rose for drivers over 40. The rate of fatal motorcycle crashes among alcohol-impaired drivers was highest among 20-24 year-olds in 1983 and among 40-44 year-olds in 2003. Because older drivers involved in fatal motorcycle crashes are more likely to be alcohol-impaired than younger drivers, future efforts to reduce alcohol-impaired driving among motorcyclists should include older drivers. Additional key findings include: The percentage of fatally injured motorcycle drivers who were alcohol-impaired declined from 1983 to 2003 in all age groups except the 55-59 years old age group. In 1983, 8.2% of the fatally injured motorcycle drivers with elevated blood alcohol concentrations (BAC) were aged 40 or older; by 2003, 48.2% of such drivers were in this age group. Motorcycle drivers in fatal crashes aged 40 and older were more likely to be alcohol impaired than car drivers aged 40 and older. Overall motorcycle mortality rates per 100,000 people declined from 1.6 in 1983 to 0.9 in 1993 and then rose to 1.2 in 2003. Rates for age groups under age 30 declined over this time period, whereas rates for age groups over 40 increased. Proven Community Strategies to Prevent Alcohol-Impaired Driving Include: Sobriety checkpoints 0.08% blood alcohol concentration laws Minimum legal drinking age laws Zero tolerance laws for young or inexperienced drivers School-based approaches to reduce riding with drinking drivers Management-supported intervention training programs for alcohol servers Mass media campaigns that are carefully planned and well executed, that attain sufficient audience exposure, and that are implemented in conjunction with other ongoing prevention activities

NHTSA Announces Discretionary Cooperative Agreements For Research Under The Crash Injury Research And Engineering Network (CIREN) The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) December 8 (69 FR 71101-71118) announced discretionary Cooperative Agreement opportunities to provide funding to Level One Trauma Centers in support of the Crash Injury Research and Engineering Network (CIREN). NHTSA anticipates funding these Cooperative Agreements in annual installments for one base year plus 4 one-year option years at NHTSA's option and subject to available funding. Due to budgetary constraints and the levels of effort applicants may propose, NHTSA is uncertain as to the number of Cooperative Agreements that will be funded. However, multiple awards will be made under this announcement. These cooperative agreements will support projects to improve the prevention, treatment, and rehabilitation of motor vehicle crash injuries to reduce deaths, disabilities and human and economic costs.
DATES: Applications must be submitted to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, Office of Contracts and Procurement (NPO-220), Attention: Dianne Proctor, 400 Seventh Street, SW., Room 5301, Washington, DC 20590. All applications submitted must include a reference to NHTSA Cooperative Agreement Program Number DTNH22-05-H-01001. Only complete packages received on or before 2 p.m. e.s.t. on February 8, 2005, will be considered for award. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: General administrative and programmatic questions may be directed to Dianne Proctor, Office of Contracts and Procurement, by e-mail at Diane.Proctor@nhtsa.dot.gov
or by phone at (202) 366-9562 and Karin E. Eddy, Office of Contracts and Procurement, by e-mail at Karin.Eddy@nhtsa.dot.gov
or by phone at (202) 366-9568. To allow for sufficient time to address questions appropriately, all questions must be submitted in writing no later 2 p.m. e.s.t., December 20, 2004, via e-mail to Karin.Eddy@nhtsa.dot.gov. Response to the questions will be posted on http://www-nrd.nhtsa.dot.gov/departments/nrd50/ciren/CIREN.html
by January 10, 2005 and in the Federal Register. The objective of the Cooperative Agreements is to fund CIREN Centers to add to the scope of data and expertise available and to increase CIREN's benefits to the public. NHTSA intends to award up to ten (10) Cooperative Agreements (depending on available funding at the time of award and the levels of effort proposed by the applicants) to support the goals of this initiative. Each Cooperative Agreement recipient will be expected to identify and coordinate an effort that supports the goals outlined in CIREN System Requirements. Subject to the availability of funds, it is anticipated that NHTSA will award up to ten (10) Cooperative Agreements to support the goals of this initiative for a period of five (5) years (i.e., one base year and four one-year Option Years, if exercised). Each Grantee will be expected to coordinate an effort that supports the goals outlined in the CIREN System Requirements. NHTSA anticipates that approximately three million dollars ($3,000,000.00) in total federal funding will be available for award of up to ten (10) Cooperative Agreements under this Federal Register Notice for the base year. Funding for each of the four (4) option years for each of the Grantees will be based on the availability of funds in future fiscal years. HRSA To Update State-By-State Self Assessments Of Trauma Care Systems The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) December 13 (69 FR 72204) to collect data from the 56 States and Territories on their current trauma care systems to assess progress since the initial survey in fiscal year 2002. This information will be used to establish a national strategy to assist in future grant opportunities to the States to improve or enhance their basic systems infrastructure in trauma care delivery, as well as their collection and usage of quality trauma data. HRSA will be collaborating with partners from within HRSA's Healthcare Systems Bureau, Division of Healthcare Preparedness (DHP), Bioterrorism Hospital Preparedness Program; HRSA's Office of Rural Health Policy; and HRSA's Maternal and Child Health Bureau. In addition, HRSA will collaborate with the Office of Public Health Emergency Preparedness; the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality; the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Center for Injury Prevention and Control; the National Highway Traffic and Safety Administration's Emergency Medical Services (EMS) Division; and affiliated professional organizations through the DHP Trauma Program's National Trauma-EMS Stakeholder Group. HRSA has included national performance measures for Trauma/EMS for this project in accordance with the requirements of the "Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) of 1993" (Public Law 103-62). This Act requires the establishment of measurable goals for Federal programs that can be reported as part of the budgetary process, thus linking funding decisions with performance. CMS Announces Improved Efforts To Reduce Medicare Payment Error Rates The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) December 13 announced new steps to measure error rates in Medicare payments more accurately and comprehensively at the contractor level, and to further reduce improper payments through targeted error improvement initiatives. "We have made significant strides in how we measure the error rate in Medicare payments, and that will enable us to do even more to bring it down,” said CMS Administrator Mark B. McClellan, M.D., Ph.D. “We have much better data that will help us pinpoint problems and allow us to work with the Medicare contractors and providers to make sure claims are submitted and paid properly." In addition, independent auditors for CMS issued an unqualified opinion on the agency’s fiscal year 2004 financial statements, which are required by the Government Management Reform Act. This year’s opinion marks the sixth consecutive year that CMS has received an unqualified opinion, demonstrating CMS’ stewardship, discipline and accountability in the implementation of its fiscal responsibilities Under the new measurement process for the Medicare error rate, the net national rate for fiscal year 2004 was 9.3 percent. The enhanced information comes from the first full year of data for an expanded program run by CMS to collect more detailed and contractor-specific information to help prevent future errors. CMS also announced new initiatives to reduce the error rate by more than half to 4 percent in four years, by building on recent reforms in payment oversight and new authorities in the Medicare law. Medicare pays more than 1 billion claims each year. In fiscal year 2004, CMS reviewed approximately 160,000 Medicare claims from the preceding year to learn, more precisely, where errors were being made. This review was the most extensive ever, providing CMS with more accurate information about contractor-specific error rates, error rates by provider type, and error rates by service type. This level of detail and accuracy is critical for CMS to identify where problems exist and target improvement efforts more effectively, and it reflects the agency’s increased commitment to use more detailed data and analysis to identify and eliminate improper payments. “We have developed the best data ever on contractor specific error rates,” said Dr. McClellan. “With this new and detailed information, we are now able to develop specific steps for the Medicare contractors to take more effective actions in reducing the error rates. Using this report and the new, comprehensive data, we can better manage our contractors, making them more accountable to the taxpayers, beneficiaries, and providers, and laying a foundation for the further contractor reforms that we intend to implement in the next few years.” The 2003 analysis identified a large and unexpected increase in the rate of non-responses. CMS adjusted the non-response rate based on past experience with non-responders and other error categories, reporting the 2003 adjusted error rate as 5.8 percent. Without adjusting for the non-response, the 2003 payment error rate would have been 9.8 percent. The 2004 data for error rate analysis was larger and more detailed than the 2003 data, just as the 2003 data was more extensive than data from previous years. Since 1996, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has annually determined the error rate for fee-for-service (FFS) claims paid by Medicare contractors, the insurance organizations that process and pay Medicare claims. From 1996 until 2002, the HHS Office of Inspector General (OIG) using a sample size of about 6,000 claims conducted the process used to measure Medicare payment error rates. The measured error rate declined from 13.8 percent in 1996 to 6.3 percent in 2002. In fiscal year 2003, and as part of the agency’s enhanced efforts to improve payment accuracy, CMS began calculating the Medicare FFS error rate and estimate of improper claim payments using a methodology approved by the OIG for the past two years. Since 2003, the OIG has assisted CMS in developing, reviewing, and formulating further actions based on the more extensive data collection. "The assistance provided by the Office of Inspector General is helping us improve our accuracy and effectiveness in identifying and responding to problems in paying claims,” said Dr. McClellan. “The majority of providers are honest and want to make sure they file their claims correctly so they can be paid timely, and we’re taking new steps to work with our contractors to make sure that happens, as we move forward with fundamental contractor reform over the next few years.” CMS’ more extensive survey, involving a more comprehensive analysis of a larger number and variety of claims, was accompanied by well-coordinated outreach to health care providers to improve claims submissions. CMS established two programs to monitor the accuracy of Medicare FFS payments: The Comprehensive Error Rate Testing (CERT) program and the Hospital Payment Monitoring Program (HPMP). The main objective of the CERT program and HPMP is to measure the degree to which CMS and its contractors are meeting the goal of “Paying it Right.” The 2004 analysis does not adjust the non-response rate, and also includes other data improvements that reflect input from Congress and other oversight partners. In particular, the sample of claims for fiscal intermediaries, who process and pay Medicare Part A claims, was doubled from the prior year so that intermediary-specific error rates could be calculated at the same levels as the Medicare carriers (Part B contractors) and durable medical equipment regional carriers. The data now permits accounting for appeals involving all types of benefits (not just hospital benefits). Thus, the more comprehensive error rates of the last 2 years are illustrative of CMS’ new measurement process. Of the total payments sampled in 2004, results of the new measurement program indicate the following payment error traits: 4.1 percent of payments had errors due to insufficient documentation being submitted (2.6 percent was reported in the 2003 analysis, which included much less information on fiscal intermediaries in 2003); 2.8 percent had errors due to non-responses to request for medical records (an unadjusted 5.0 percent rate was found in 2003); 1.6 percent had errors due to medically unnecessary services (1.3 percent in 2003); 0.7 percent had errors due to incorrect coding (0.7 percent in 2003); and the remaining 0.1 percent had other errors (0.2 percent in 2003). The claims included in this analysis were submitted before many of the agency’s recently-implemented initiatives to reduce error rates took effect. The more comprehensive data provides CMS with the opportunity to enhance and expand its efforts to monitor the impact of these initiatives. As part of its general efforts to further reduce the Medicare error rate, the CMS contractors will be required to: Develop corrective action plans that include efforts to educate providers about the importance of submitting thorough and complete medical records; Identify where additional review of claims and education on submitting claims is needed, based on information that shows where the highest percentage of errors on overused billing codes are occurring; and Use the performance results to develop local efforts to lower their error rates by addressing the cause of the errors and outlining corrective steps. "We've taken major steps in recent years to get much better data on payment accuracy for each and every one of our contractors, and in every case, better measures mean an ability to reduce error rate for those contractors,” said Dr. McClellan. “We've taken a major step this year to improve data on the fiscal intermediaries, and we are now using this information to drive down their error rates in the same way." In addition, CMS is continually developing educational material and information for healthcare providers as part as of "The Medicare Learning Network.” CMS has developed over 250 national provider education articles annually that outline, on a flow basis and in plain language, the coverage, billing and coding rules associated with Medicare program changes.

Wall Street Journal, 2/9/93: "The Most Dangerous Vehicle on the Road" by Walter Olson
  "The Most Dangerous Vehicle On the Road" By Walter Olson Wall Street Journal, February 9, 1993 Jury interviews suggest that last month's $ 105 million verdict in Moseley v. General Motors was based in part on anger at GM's unrepentance: Despite lawsuits and press reports fingering its 1973-87 trucks as unsafe, the company has refused to concede they are flawed at all. Soon after the verdict GM continued its defiance by counterattacking, charging that crash tests done for an NBC expose' in November were rigged by attaching incendiary devices to the trucks. Serious though these charges might seem, some have already dismissed them as GM damage control. Are the trucks, in fact, unsafe? Try to identify from this list the GM truck that Clarence Ditlow, director of the Center for Auto Safety, told NBC was a "rolling firebomb" and that NBC, summing up his charges, described as the "most dangerous vehicle out there on the road." Fatal Crash Rate (per 10,000 registered vehicle years) (National Highway Traffic Safety Administration)
A 1.162 B 1.446 C 1.514 D 1.652 E 1.824 F 2.212 G 2.347 H 2.455 The correct answer is C, the GM full-size vehicle in the Moseley case. (Seventeen-year old Shannon Moseley died in the fire after his GM truck was hit by a drunken driver.) Of the entries on the list with worse records, D represents passenger cars as a general average; E, F, G, and H, light pickup trucks from various makers (Ford, Nissan, Toyota, Chrysler). Of course, one must approach numbers of this sort with caution: For example, models bought by younger and more aggressive drivers may show higher crash rates through no fault of their design. Still, anyone who imagines the GM truck (1.514) an unconscionable death trap would also be wise to avoid the large majority of other vehicles on the road (1.652 to 2.455). Many analysts cry foul at comparing full-size pickups to smaller vehicles, since bigger is known to be safer as a general rule. In the litigation context, that's a strange cavil: If auto makers may freely offer small trucks to the public, why punish them for offering a large truck with a much better safety rating? But in any case, consider B, the full-size Ford entry, which was in fact the market's closest competitor to the GM model. (A, Dodge's full-size entry, did not score a hit with consumers, whatever its safety virtues.) Ford's very thin edge over the GM model may or may not represent anything more than statistical noise, driver bias, and so forth. Anyone who chooses to live in a wood rather than a brick house accepts a far wider adverse safety differential. One policy, of course, would be to punish any firm that fell behind in safety competition, as determined years later in statistical retrospect. That would ensure litigators a steady supply of provender, much as if, out on the veld, they were entitled to munch on whichever gazelles were at the rear of the pack. (The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety has acknowledged, by the way, that the current safety scare is unlikely to add materially to the premiums that GM truck owners pay; the accidents in question are far too rare.) When trial lawyers took their case to the general public through the media, they stressed intuition rather than statistics. It seems that GM, alone among auto makers, had gone about hanging gas tanks on the side of its trucks like dartboards, outside the protective frame rail. The tanks "were placed in about as stupid a place as they can possibly be placed," one of the plaintiff's lawyers informed "NBC Dateline." In a "side impact or a sideswipe impact, " plaintiff s expert Byron Bloch explained to a rapt NBC reporter, "the fuel tank gets crushed ... There is an immediate holocaust." So the overall numbers didn't matter. GM's design choice had invited specific, avoidable deaths, and the company must be punished. As it turns out, neither NBC nor most other news outlets bothered to report that the GM trucks have actually scored better over the years in avoiding fatal crashes when it comes to side-impact collisions, their presumed weak point. Specifically, the full-size GM trucks did slightly better (.196 fatal side-impact crashes per 10,000 registered vehicle years) than the comparable Fords (.200) and almost as well as the Dodges (.190), though the three are bunched so closely together that the numbers hardly matter. How on earth could these trucks have done better in side crashes, given that GM itself chose to move the tanks inboard in a 1988 redesign? Maybe the numbers are a fluke. Or maybe it's that the trade-offs in car safety are not well understood even by experts. Any possible placement of the fuel tank "causes" some accidents and averts others. Respectable designers have tried every gas-tank location at one time or another: front (as in old Volkswagen Beetles), rear (the Ford Pinto and many others), inside the passenger compartment (older trucks), or underneath (now usual, despite the hazards of flying gravel, sparks, ground-slams, and broken axles). All have been rejected at other times as unsafe. Maybe the distinctive narrow frame of GM trucks--popular with customers, but damned by the plaintiff's lawyers because it required the gas tanks to be placed outboard--offers some sort of obscure advantage in side crashes. It's hard to know. We do know that although you are apparently no more likely to have a fatal side-impact crash in your GM truck, if you do have one it is somewhat more likely to involve a fire. To that extent, intuition--but not the trial lawyers' case--is vindicated. We also know that in GM trucks, as in all other kinds, you are much more likely to die in a front-end than in a side crash, and vastly more likely to die in a crash without a fire than in one with. When fire is present in a fatal crash, it's often in the sort of high-force collisions that would have been lethal in any case--though the jury viewed the Moseley case as an exception. And--hardly a surprise given the statistics--it turns out that GM gas tanks are not exactly as fragile or exposed as DDT eggshells, as viewers might have concluded from watching the NBC video or trial lawyer's summations. The tanks not only complied with but far exceeded the U.S. government's safety standards, which specifically address the danger of gas-tank breakage in side crashes. (Fully obeying this kind of law, it turns out, will not keep you from getting sued.) In fact it takes about 4,000 side-impact crashes in a GM pickup to get one fire with a major injury or fatality, which means the supposed "rolling fire-bombs" may compare favorably with haystacks or mounds of feathers as objects to crash into. The more data we see on the safety record of existing cars, the more dubious the safety scares of the past begin to look. The Audi 5000 affair, in which one of the safest cars on the road was wrongly accused of "sudden acceleration," is only the best known of a whole series of lawsuit-driven campaigns that have collapsed in disgrace and refutation. Remarkably, even the affair of the "exploding" Ford Pinto--universally hailed as the acme of product liability success--is starting to look like hype. In a summer 1991 Rutgers Law Review article Gary Schwartz demolishes "the myth of the Pinto case." Actual deaths in Pinto fires have come in at a known 27, not the expected thousand or more. More startling, Schwartz shows that everyone's received ideas about the fabled "smoking gun" memo are false.  The actual memo did not pertain to Pintos, or even Ford products, but to American cars in general; it dealt with rollovers, not rear-end collisions; it did not contemplate the matter of tort liability at all, let alone accept it as cheaper than a design change; it assigned a value to human life because federal regulators, for whose eyes it was meant, themselves employed that concept in their deliberations; and the value it used was one that they, the regulators, had set forth in documents. In retrospect, Schwartz writes, the Pinto's safety record appears to have been very typical of its time and class. Ford, like GM, lost a $ 100 million verdict, although not much of that survived appeal. The scandal of punitive damages is that they're handed down with none of the due-process protections we'd accord targets charged with genuine criminal wrongdoing: strong screening of unreliable evidence, proof beyond a reasonable doubt, prosecution by independent professionals rather than interested parties, and so forth. Until we furnish such protection, punitive damages--as in the Moseley case--will threaten to make a travesty of justice. **** Walter Olson, senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, is the author of The Litigation Explosion.

  The most dangerous squad in Baghdad
By P. Mitchell Prothero
United Press International
Baghdad, Iraq, Jul. 7 (UPI) -- "How'd you end up with us, is this an embed?" the ridiculously young looking soldier asked me as we crouched on the roof of a power transformer station, surveying downtown Baghdad. He's peering down the sight of his belt-fed machine gun at a group of Iraqis located about 500 meters (yards) away towards the Tigris River when he realizes that they're armed. "Shit, shit, they have weapons," he yells across the roof at his corporal. "So fucking kill them," comes the pithy reply from the other ridiculously young solider. "Wait, wait. They're ICDC or ING or whatever the fuck they're called now," yells another. "They're with us." In the last week the Iraqi Civil Defense Corps has been renamed the Iraqi National Guard, a distinction that only means that the Iraqis will not be killed by the four man team that's protecting this impromptu command post. The roof is hot. Baghdad's high temperature on Wednesday is 118 degrees and the men of squad two, second platoon of the 1st Cavalry Division's 1-9 Regiment have already lost three men to the heat and it's only about half past noon. When told that I had just happened to hook up with their unit after being caught in the middle of a running gun battle in central Baghdad, one of the men laughs. "Well asshole, you just hooked up with the most dangerous squad in Baghdad," he says without looking up from his weapon, which is now trained on a small group of men several blocks away who are certainly not ING. Just what might be ordinary bravado from a young soldier echoes across the cement rooftop, his squad-mate clarifies. "No really we are," he says. "Out of the 11 of us, only two haven't won the Purple Heart in the last four months. It sucks to be us." He means that to be in his unit offers a nine out of 11 chance to be wounded in action. Having been quiet for the past 10 days as Iraq saw its sovereignty returned, insurgents picked the morning that the interim Prime Minister Iyad Allawi announced sweeping security measures that effectively allow him to declare martial law to stamp out Iraq's bloody insurgency to attack U.S. and ING forces in central Baghdad. Terror attacks are common in Baghdad. Insurgents attacking convoys and U.S. bases outside Baghdad are frequent. But masked gunmen running through central Baghdad in fire fights with police, ING and U.S. military is unheard of. It barely happened during the invasion of Iraq. The morning began with a mortar attack on Allawi's residence, which we couldn't get close enough to investigate. Then suddenly traffic became even worse than its typically insufferable level. And the sight of U.S. Apache attack helicopters sweeping on firing runs in downtown Baghdad indicated something major was happening. Having deftly avoided much of the traffic, my driver and I were looking for what was happening, expecting a cordon of military vehicles keeping us away from the action. What we didn't expect was that our deftness -- a result of my driver's surreal ability to avoid traffic jams -- would drive ourselves into the middle of a firefight. As bullets flew around our car, which was hastily abandoned, we ran for the shelter of a nearby hospital. We could see U.S. troops far down the broad boulevard. And there was a lot of firing, but we couldn't see who was shooting or at what. But we could hear the bullets smacking trees nearby the now abandoned car and U.S. troops at the end of the road weren't shooting or getting shot at, making the usual calculations of how to safely cover a firefight -- avoid the people getting shot at -- useless. Having decided that the car was a safer option than huddling and waiting to figure out who was doing the shooting, we broke for the car and headed for the nearest Iraqi Police station to find out what was going on. The police station was milling with police carrying assault rifles and some casually mentioned that they were currently under attack from unknown forces. But the shooting had just stopped, likely connected to the missiles fired from an Apache overhead and the black smoke pluming into the sky a few blocks away. Just as the Iraqis were trying to decide whether they were still under attack, three Bradley Fighting Vehicles of the 1st Cav. arrived and dumped three squads of infantry into the area. As they took up defensive positions, they uncharacteristically ignored me, probably due to gunfire directed on their positions. It wasn't well aimed and hit no one in the vicinity, but it caused the platoon leader to send out a squad to stop it. Walking the streets of Haifa -- the neighborhood -- was tense and full of intermittent gunfire, causing the squad to take a solid 30 minutes to travel just a handful of blocks. Having picked the power station as a base, it was checked and gunners assigned to the roof to protect both the station itself and provide supporting fire to a group of ING reportedly a few blocks away. They were pinned down by insurgents and had three wounded men. So several armored vehicles arrived with the rest of the platoon and a rescue mission planned in the small courtyard of the building. It was decided that the rescue operation -- headed to the building four blocks away -- would be done on foot. As the 1st Lieutenant commanding the platoon conferred over maps and with his company commander by radio, a hulking sergeant major addressed the men. "We are expecting resistance, this is full weapons on, men," he bellowed. "If you don't like it, soldier, then shoot it. Shoot boxes or anything you think might be an (improvised explosive device). They are expecting us." Setting out in long lines of men covering each side of the street, the soldiers faced not only the odd gunshot, threat of ambush, or, worse, a roadside bomb, but also the stares of Iraqis who were gathering outside their homes and shops to watch the deadly show. Some scowled, others waved, and the men of second platoon were not happy walking through a rough neighborhood of Baghdad in daylight with little armored vehicle support. And the Apaches had run out of fuel and retuned home so there was no air cover. But as they moved down a side alley along, little happened. Leaving the alley, they broke into the open and quickly established a defensive perimeter around the ING building. One squad ran for the entrance, as the others provided cover, only to find the building locked. "Open this door or I'll open it myself," one soldier yelled at a confused Iraqi man outside the building who clearly had no idea what he was talking about. The ING, it turns out, had already left, even remembering to lock up the facility. "I hate this shit," said the lieutenant. "We have terrible (communications) with the ICDC or ING, or whatever they are. I can't believe this." But even as the group withdraws, one soldier sees something a block away. And a report of men using a nearby house to stage attacks has just come through. Three doors are hit. The first two have only women and children. The third small building has 12 fighting age men in it. And all of their identification is suspicious enough that -- despite the absence of weapons -- it's decided to arrest them for questioning. So second platoon marches their 12 prisoners -- and a growing band of curious reporters -- back the vehicles. As they are loaded into armored vehicles for the ride back to the unit's forward operating base, one of the men manages to slip away and actually sits down at a café down the block pretending like he wasn't involved. A translator for one news organization notices and the reporter innocently asks one soldier why the man was let go. "Get that guy," cries the lieutenant, who then walks over to the café himself and grabs the man, who doesn't even try and deny anything. He just shrugs and follows his friends into the back of the vehicle. Moments later, rifle shots ring out as one soldier notices that the street down the block is now littered with cardboard boxes. He carefully puts a round through each one to make sure none holds a roadside bomb. "You can't be too careful in Baghdad," he shrugs. [UPI Perspectives]

Name: Email: Crime is defined by the Merriam-Webster dictionary as
an act or the commission of an act that is forbidden or the omission of a duty that is commanded by a public law and that makes the offender liable to punishment by that law.   Laws are designed to protect us and ensure our safety in all aspects of our lives: physical, financial, psychological and social.  Yet not a day does go by that we don’t hear of crimes taking place in our city or state.  When a crime is committed, public safety becomes endangered and specific individuals or groups may feel violated.  While we would like to avoid such events, they take place all too often.  Here are some statistics that demonstrate this:
Every two
minutes, somewhere in America, someone is sexually assaulted.
In 2002, there were a total of 4,854 cases of aggravated assault in
Washington DC.  On a daily basis, this computes to 13.2 aggravated assaults a day.
In Maryland, there were 3,228 cases of larceny and thefts per 100,000 people in 2002.  This is one-third higher than the national average rate of 2,445.8 cases per 100,000.
In Detroit, there were 41.79 murders per 100,000 people in 2002.  This is alarmingly way above the national average rate of 5.6 for the same year.
In 2002, with the exception of burglaries, Philadelphia
led all crime levels which were above the national average rates for murder, forcible rape, robbery, aggravated assaults, larceny/theft and motor vehicle theft.
To find out more crime statistics in the
US, visit the
University of Michigan Library.
In addition to crimes against individuals,   
Corporate crime
has recently jolted the corporate world with the likes of the
Enron
scandal and the
Martha Stewart
arrest.  Across
America, worker rights are often violated by threats of firing and other reprisals made to those who dare to exercise their lawful right to collective bargaining and unions.   In 2000, when a department of meat cutters at a Wal-Mart center in
Texas
voted 7-3 in favor of unionization, Wal-Mart eliminated the meat cutting department, choosing instead to pre-cut meats, resulting in the elimination of meat cutting jobs nationwide.  The garment and fabric factories
of
New York
are filled with immigrant workers, many of whom do not have proper working documents. Many of these workers end up enduring poor working conditions for fear of deportation and
INS
investigations, encouraged by the factory owners.  Through collective bargaining, unions protect the rights of workers by giving them fair representation in the work place.  On the contrary, some union leaders have been charged for their involvement in crime activities (racketeering, fraud and tax evasion, embezzlement, and extortion).  Union or not, corporate crime exists on both ends of the continuum, where the workers continue to be victimized and their rights violated.   
Another major type of crime is terrorism.  The tragic events of 9/11 and the terrorists that brought on those acts of destruction have changed the lives of Americans forever.  Support the
fight against terrorism.  
The War on Drugs
deals with addressing the violation of drug laws.  Tremendous resources have been devoted and spent on this war, locally and internationally.  The recent extradition
of drug criminal Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela to the
US
is a sign that indeed the
US
is continuing to wage a war against drug crime.
Social and Economic Problems Caused by Crime
Our social and economic problems are often a direct result of crime.  In a vicious circle, these problems can fuel crime even more.  For example, those who commit theft and burglaries often do so because of their need for money.  These individuals may be unemployed, incapable of finding work, homeless, sick or impoverished.  These crimes become a tempting way to quickly acquire money.  Unfortunately, when left unpunished, these individuals get the misconception that crime pays.  It is this thinking that encourages some individuals to continue their criminal ways, discouraging them from finding other activities that would give them some normality and stability in their lives.  This way of thinking reinforces crime.
Another crime, prostitution, is frequently associated with drug addiction.  Many prostitutes find it difficult to change their work because of their drug addiction.  Drugs require significant cash and prostitution provides this, faster and easier than legitimate work.  Prostitution often will lead to other crimes such as
people trafficking,
sexual abuse, and rape.  Those who exploit women often have no regard for people’s lives.  This disregard often leads to physical abuse and even murder.  In addition, prostitution can increase the spread of diseases such as AIDS, other
STD’s and hepatitis. 
On a larger scale, drug addiction fuels the illicit drug industry.  Through our web site War on Drugs, you can learn more about the social and economic problems that drugs cause.  In organized crime, you will find other violations related to drug trafficking.  These include money laundering, smuggling and illegal sale of weapons, credit card fraud and counterfeiting.  Poverty often leads to the problem of homelessness.  Those who live on the streets often experience hunger and disease making them more likely to resort to committing theft and burglary as a means to eat or to obtain medicine.  Out on the streets the homeless
are exposed more to the risks of drug addiction and other unwanted social behaviors.  All of these factors fuel crime.
Solving the Root Causes of Crime
In order to eradicate crime, we need to address the root causes.  These include, but are not limited to, greed, inadequate corporate oversight, poverty, lack of education, homelessness, drug addiction, racial hatred, and lax gun laws.  Education is one of the biggest factors that plays a role in what becomes of an individual in their adulthood.  Those who have an education possess the training and skills needed to make them marketable to potential employers.  Indeed, even for jobs that pay only a minimum wage, employers likely will prefer interviewing candidates with a decent education over those without.  Thus, many of the uneducated may find themselves unemployed, living in sub-standard housing and in impoverished conditions.  And as money becomes scarce, many of them might be tempted to engage in criminal activities.  At Grassroots.org, we encourage everyone to pursue formal education and stress the importance of governments and universities helping make it accessible to all.  We strongly believe that every American citizen deserves an education and it’s especially important to make it more available to those families who are not able to readily afford it. Education can help eradicate poverty, which will in turn reduce the crime rate.
Poverty often pushes children to drop out of school.  Those children who do not attend school may end up roaming the streets, exposing themselves to criminal elements and activities.  This is why it is imperative that communities provide safe places where children can gather inside, away from street life.  These include school clubs, youth clubs, and sports and recreational centers where children and youth are given support and supervision through educational and developmental programs.  Without alternatives to schools, children can easily get involved in petty crimes such as shoplifting, residential break-ins, car theft and vandalism.  After the petty crimes, these children may graduate into the more serious crimes of drug trafficking, sexual offences and gang violence.
Crime can also be related to the probability of being caught and the extent of possible sentencing.  On our web site Sexual Abuse, we present information showing that most rapes and most acts of sexual abuse are committed by individuals with whom the victims are related or otherwise acquainted.  Such relationships can discourage victims from reporting incidents to law enforcement agencies, thus failing to bring the culprits to justice.  Part of the underreporting problem is the social stigma that is attached to these victims.  Although they are victims, they are often blamed for the crime, labelled as being promiscuous and loose.  This allows the real offenders to get away unpunished, leaving them free to offend again.  As citizens, we need to adopt laws and reporting procedures that will give full physical and psychological protection to victims who report crime.  Let us not allow offenders to get away with their crimes, giving them an opportunity to repeat.
Corporate crime is becoming increasingly global and its consequences can be devastating.  Consumers are defrauded.  Our environment (soil, air and water) is often compromised.  Our personal safety can be placed at risk by lobbyists who buy influence but do not have the interest of the greater majority at heart.  A case in point is the
Federal Ban on Assault Weapons.  The National Rifle Association, a powerful lobbyist organization that opposes the federal ban, including background checks at gun shows, has been a very large donor of money to political parties since 1989.  Although the federal ban and background checks help to ensure our safety, these two issues remain unresolved today.  Visit our web site
Lobbyists
for a more thorough discussion on influence buying.  Scandals such as the Enron accounting fraud have resulted in job loss, pension loss, investment loss, a negative impact on the confidence of the American public on the corporate system, loss of taxes due to the Treasury and more.  Today, as reported by
Citizen Works, there are many other corporations today being investigated for irregular accounting practices.  A few examples are K-Mart, Qwest Communications, WorldCom and Xerox.
We must work to curtail corporate greed.  The practice of “influence buying” needs to be stopped.  Corporations must have tighter controls over their accounting reporting procedures.  We call for greater transparency as well so that irregularities in accounting practices can be detected early to mitigate any damages.  The practice of corporate disclosure needs to be widened.  This will allow consumers and shareholders to become fully aware of corporate records on the environment, human rights, worker safety and financial matters.  It will also allow us to know about corporate criminal records and litigation records.  Multiple functions within consulting firms need to be severed and made independent from each other to prevent conflicts of interest.  The Arthur Andersen firm was caught in such a conflict in the Enron scandal, as the firm served both as the accountants and consultants for Enron.  Arthur Andersen was later found guilty of obstruction of justice.  The company was essentially shut down by that and other accounting scandals.
Our prison rehabilitation and prison systems need reform.  A
report
published by the Urban Institute confirms that although the number of parolees regularly being released from our prison system is large, the number of them going back into prison is alarming.  In 1980, as many as 27,000 parolee violators returned to prisons. By 2000, this number increased to 203,000.  This amount represents a 652 percent increase.  There are a number of reasons for this:
Continuing social problems drive parolees back to crime. 
The number of parole officers is not enough to handle the demand of case loads. 
Educational and vocational programs for inmates in prisons need improvement.
Prison personnel need more training in prison based inmate rehabilitation.  This will ensure a higher success rate of inmate re-integration in to society.  Many private prisons have high staff turnover, chronic understaffing and inexperienced correctional officers.  These private prisons are focused primarily on profit, with the inmates being secondary concerns.
If those in charge of our prison system give priority first and foremost to the rehabilitation and re-integration of inmates, this in turn will have a positive effect on the reduction of crime.
Calls to Action
As law abiding citizens, it is imperative that we live our lives according to the rules of our land.  It is also our civic duty to report any crimes that we witness.  The reasons are simple: our laws are meant to preserve the quiet and peaceful enjoyment of living in this great country of the
United States.  Anytime a law is broken, it can compromise the safety of our citizens.  What makes our nation so great is the freedom given to us by our forefathers: our freedom of speech, of religion, of protest, to vote, to get an education, to go to work, to information and many more!  These freedoms are valuable and precious to all of us.  These freedoms are the reasons why the
UShas waged several battles on crime including the War on Drugs and the War on Terrorism. 
Although the costs of these battles are plenty, the rewards are worth it.   9/11 has changed our lives forever, no doubt.  Today, there are Americans who still live in fear of when and where the next terrorist attacks will happen.  Immediately after the strikes on the
World
Trade
Center, such fear was overwhelming and widespread.  There is great debate on whether the
US
is winning the war in
Iraq.  Many question whether our soldiers should even be there.  However, there is no question that 9/11 has not repeated itself in
USsoil. There is also no question in our minds that the War on Drugs is having a positive effect given the fall and extradition of many Colombian drug lords.  Grassroots.org is asking you to support our law enforcement agencies.  Give encouragement to those who put their lives on the line to protect our freedoms.  And most importantly, let each of us live according to the laws of our nation.  Democracy is powerful.  Freedom makes the war on crime even more worth it!

Background information
Conference of the Parties
Address by Ambassador Luigi Lauriola, Chairman of the Ad Hoc Committee on The Elaboration of a Convention Against Transnational Organized Crime at The Millenium Assembly of the United Nations General Assembly, New York, November 2000 The Convention represents a major step forward in the fight against transnational organized crime and signifies the recognition of UN Member States that this is a serious and growing problem that can only be solved through close international cooperation. The Convention, concluded at the 10th session of the Ad Hoc Committee established by the General Assembly to deal with this problem, is a legally binding instrument committing States that ratify it to taking a series of measures against transnational organized crime. These include the creation of domestic criminal offences to combat the problem, and the adoption of new, sweeping frameworks for mutual legal assistance, extradition, law-enforcement cooperation and technical assistance and training. States Parties will be able to rely on one another in investigating, prosecuting and punishing crimes committed by organized criminal groups where either the crimes or the groups who commit them have some element of transnational involvement. This should make it much more difficult for offenders and organized criminal groups to take advantage of gaps in national law, jurisdictional problems or a lack of accurate information about the full scope of their activities. The Convention deals with the fight against organized crime in general and some of the major activities in whichï¿½transnational organized crime is commonly involved, such as money laundering, corruption and the obstruction of investigations or prosecutions. To supplement the Convention, two Protocols also tackle specific areas of transnational organized crime that are of particular concern to UN Member States. The Protocol against the Smuggling of Migrants deals with the growing problem of organized criminal groups who smuggle migrants, often at high risk to the migrants and at great profit for the offenders. The Protocol against Trafficking in Persons deals with the problem of modern slavery, in which the desire of people to seek a better life is taken advantage of by organized criminal groups. Migrants are often confined or coerced into exploitive or oppressive forms of employment, often in the sex trade or in dangerous occupations, with the illicit incomes generated from these activities going to organized crime. The Protocols also commit countries which ratify them to making the basic subject of the Protocol a criminal offence and to adopting other specific measures, such as controls on travel documents, to combat the problem. These supplement the more general measures found in the Convention, and countries must become parties to the Convention itself before they can become parties to any of the Protocols. A third Protocol, dealing with the illicit manufacturing of and trafficking in firearms, parts and components, and ammunition, remains under discussion. The texts of these documents were developed over 11 sessions of the Ad Hoc Committee, and footnoted texts may be found under each session. The Convention was finalized at the 10th session, and the complete text forms part of the Report of that session. The Protocols dealing with the smuggling of migrants and trafficking in persons were finalized at the 11th session and are reported there. These three instruments were adopted by the UN Millenium General Assembly on 15 November 2000, and final texts are included in the Report of that session. Instruments Finalized instruments: United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime and following protocols: Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children, supplementing the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime Protocol against the Smuggling of Migrants by Land, Air and Sea, supplementing the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime (PDF) English,

Organized Crime
This compilation of resources focuses on adult gangs, gangsters, the mafia, and international gangs. For more information about youth gangs, look under Gangs. "Transnational organized crime will be one of the major problems facing policy makers in the 21st century. It will be a defining issue of the 21st century as the Cold War was for the 20th century and Colonialism was for the 19th. No area of international affairs will remain untouched as political and economic systems and the social fabric of many countries will deteriorate under the increasing financial power of international organized crime groups." -Louise Shelley, Director of TraCCC.

http://www.nagia.org/Crips_and_Bloods.htm
Surprisingly, little has been written about the historical significance of black gangs in Los Angeles (LA). Literature and firsthand interviews with Los Angeles residents seem to point to three significant periods relevant to the development of the contemporary black gangs. The first period, which followed WWII and significant black migrations from the South, is when the first major black clubs formed. After the Watts rebellion of 1965, the second period gave way to the civil rights period of Los Angeles where blacks, including those who where former club members who became politically active for the remainder of the 1960s. By the early 1970s black street gangs began to reemerge. By 1972, the Crips were firmly established and the Bloods were beginning to organize. This period saw the rise of LA’s newest gangs, which continued to grow during the 1970s, and later formed in several other cities throughout the United States by the 1990s. While black gangs do not make up the largest or most active gang population in Los Angeles today, their influence on street gang culture nationally has been profound. Article by Alejandro A. Alonso.

As the "gangsta" culture continues to spread throughout North America, the influence of California and Chicago gangs are now being felt in both large metropolitan areas and with increasing frequency in small, rural communities. The lesson has been well-learned that the problem of street gangs is one that touches all ethnic and socio-economic classes. However, as law enforcement agencies have attempted to deal with the gang problem in their respective communities, some very significant differences have been discovered from the historic perception of these gangs, and their behaviors in areas outside of Chicago or Los Angeles.

http://usinfo.state.gov/regional/ea/chinaaliens/polishprof.htm
Paper delivered by Professor Emil W. Plywaczewski, Ph.D., at the 3rd Annual Symposium "Crime and Its Control in Greater China", June 21-22, 2002, University of Hong Kong, PRC. Summary: Chinese organized crime has become well established in every major Chinese community across the world, Plywaczewski says. Members include community leaders as well as ordinary workers. "It is difficult to penetrate this subculture," Plywaczewski writes, "because members have no prior criminal records.... They can conceal their criminal activities through their involvement in lawful business activities." Plywaczewski provides detailed information on Chinese people-smuggling operations in Austria, Hungary, Poland and other European countries. He notes that Chinese criminal groups operate in isolated "cells," each with a specific duty and unaware of other cells in the criminal operation except the one from which it accepts assignments. In the case of people smuggling, some organizations will, for a higher fee, provide their "customers" with "a guarantee of effectiveness." That is, the smugglers guarantee that they will get their client to a target country no matter how many times they might be stopped by law enforcement.

http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/nij/international/chinese.html
The organizational structure of Chinese organized crime in the United States is quite complex. Broadly defined, there is a great variety of Chinese criminal organizations. These include gangs, secret societies, triads, tongs, Taiwanese organized crime groups, and strictly US-based tongs and gangs. According to Ko-lin Chin, the foremost academic expert in the U.S. on Chinese organized crime, there is no empirical support for the belief that there is a well-organized, monolithic, hierarchical criminal cartel called the "Chinese Mafia." Chin says: "My findings...do not support the notion that a chain of command exists among these various crime groups or that they coordinate with one another routinely in international crimes such as heroin trafficking, money laundering, and the smuggling of aliens" (1996:123).

http://www.fbi.gov/hq/cid/orgcrime/ocshome.htm
Organized crime, in the U.S. and around the world, is a critical concern of the law enforcement community. The cooperation among these organized criminal enterprises in recent years has allowed them to greatly increase the scope and magnitude of their illicit activities. Our world has seen widespread and unprecedented political, economic, social, and technological changes in the last two decades. Organized criminal enterprises have been quick to take advantage of the opportunities created by these changes to satisfy their greed and lust for power. The cost to communities and individuals, in terms of pain and suffering caused by the violence and exploitation associated with these organizations, is incalculable. Also the damage to society resulting from these criminal organizations and their influence on labor unions, political institutions, financial markets, and major industries is immeasurable. In fact, a look at the economic impact alone gives a glimpse of the importance of this issue. The Center for Strategic and International Studies, Global Organized Crime Project, Financial Crimes Task Force estimates global organized crime reaps profits of close to $1 trillion per year. The FBI's fight against organized crime is unlike other criminal programs. Instead of focusing on these crimes as individual events, the FBI's Organized Crime Program targets the entire organization responsible for a variety of criminal activities. The FBI has found that even if key individuals in an organization are removed, the depth and financial strength of the organization often allows the enterprise to continue.

The rapid spread of international crime since the end of the Cold War is unprecedented in scale, facilitated by globalization and technological advances, and poses a significant challenge to the United States and democratic governments and free market economies around the world. The President has identified international crime as a direct and immediate threat to the national security of the United States. To meet this challenge, the Departments of Justice, State, and Treasury--working closely with numerous federal agencies--jointly developed a comprehensive national strategy to fight international crime and reduce its impact on Americans. The International Crime Control Strategy, which was released in May 1998, provides a dynamic action plan that serves as a roadmap for a coordinated, effective, long-term attack on international crime.

La Cosa Nostra or LCN -- also known as the Mafia, the mob, the outfit, the office -- is a collection of Italian-American organized crime “families” that has been operating in the United States since the 1920s. For nearly three quarters of a century, beginning during the time of Prohibition and extending into the 1990s, the LCN was clearly the most prominent criminal organization in the U.S. Indeed, it was synonymous with organized crime. In recent years, the LCN has been severely crippled by law enforcement, and over the past decade has been challenged in a number of its criminal markets by other organized crime groups. Nevertheless, with respect to those criteria that best define the harm capacity of criminal organizations, it is still pre-eminent. The LCN has greater capacity to gain monopoly control over criminal markets, to use or threaten violence to maintain that control, and to corrupt law enforcement and the political system than does any of its competitors. As one eminent scholar has also pointed out, “no other criminal organization [in the United States] has controlled labor unions, organized employer cartels, operated as a rationalizing force in major industries, and functioned as a bridge between the upperworld and the underworld” (Jacobs, 1999:128). It is this capacity that distinguishes the LCN from all other criminal organizations in the U.S. James O. Finckenauer, Ph.D., National Institute of Justice.

http://www.rcmp.ca/ccaps/media_e.htm
The Canadian public is exposed to extensive media coverage of events related to organized crime (OC). Every day, an impressive array of stories appear in both print and broadcast media. A study carried out last year estimated at more than 27,000 the number of articles that referred to organized crime in 15 Canadian dailies and magazines over a six-year period (Beare & Ronderos, 2001). This massive exposure is significant, as the media are among the sources of information people count on to mould their opinion of the world around them. And with respect to crime, surveys have shown that up to 95% of people say they rely on the media as their primary source of information in this regard (Graber, 1979). Given the extensive OC media coverage here in Canada and its role as a possible source of public information in this regard, it seems imperative that we answer the following question: Does media coverage of OC-related events influence public opinion, and, if so, how?

Police managers feel that the media tend to focus too much on organized crime activities that involve violence. Because of this emphasis on violence and sensationalism, the media often underplay organized crime activities with no apparent violence. The activities downplayed the most by the media, in terms of impact, are money laundering and economic crimes. Police managers also stated that the media give too much exposure to positive or socially acceptable events linked to organized crime. They consider, however, that police operations, trials and political interventions related to organized crime receive adequate and relatively proper coverage. Police managers are concerned about a lack of in-depth articles, editorials and feature stories that could provide an in-depth look at issues related organized crime. According to some managers, the biggest shortcoming is that the media never provide a comprehensive view of the actual causes and overall impact of organized crime in Canada.

While many OC studies have been produced that describe or examine a particular OC activity or OC group, relatively little attention has been focused in any systematic way on the impact of OC on Canada, Canadians and their communities.

This chapter inquires into the mafia phenomenon in Russia to evaluate its potential for threatening the success of economic reform. The first section considers the term mafia in popular parlance and in the economic literature. The second section looks at the conditions historically associated with the development of mafias. The third section addresses the underground economy in the latter years of the Soviet Union as the framework from which the current Russian mafia, the subject of the fourth section, developed. The claim that Russia's problems with crime are merely an early stage of capitalism is addressed in the fifth section. A final section considers public policy approaches. Annelise Anderson.

http://organizedcrime.about.com/library/weekly/aaredfellasa.htm
There are fifty ways of saying "to steal" in Russian, and the Russian mafia uses them all. It is the world's largest, busiest and possibly meanest collection of organized hoods, consisting of 5,000 gangs and 3 million people who work for or with them. Its reach extends into all fifteen of the former Soviet republics, across eleven time zones and one- sixth of the earth's land mass. It intrudes into every field of Western concern: the nascent free market, privatization, disarmament, military conversion, foreign humanitarian relief and financial aid, even state reserves of currency and gold. And it has begun to creep toward the restof Europe and the United States--"looking at the West as a wolf looks at sheep," a Russian crime specialist told me.

Organized crime rings in Russia and the rest of the former Soviet Union are increasingly hacking into U.S. e-commerce and banking Web sites, posing an enormous economic threat. Hackers have launched computer viruses and disruptive denial-of-service attacks, but the biggest danger comes from hackers with ties to organized crime breaking into computers, FBI officials said. Spearheading the organized hacking rings is the Russian Mafia, security experts say. The Russian Mafia has infiltrated many businesses in the former Soviet Union, and is becoming increasingly sophisticated in computer crimes. Article by Laura Lorek appearing in EWeek, July 16, 2001.

Location and call number
Russian organized crime constitutes a direct threat to the national security interests of the United States by fostering instability in a nuclear-armed power. Left unchecked, Russia is in jeopardy of becoming a criminal syndicalist state under the control of corrupt government bureaucrats, politicians, quasi-businessmen, and criminals. Composed of senior-level U.S. government representatives and private-sector experts, the task force assesses the breadth and depth of Russian organized crime and corruption, addresses current U.S. policy, and makes recommendations on how best to confront these challenges.

http://members.tripod.com/~orgcrime/russexy.htm
An article by Lydia S. Rosner, John Jay College. This article deals with the perceptions inherent in that phenomenon called the Russian Mafia. It examines a theoretical problem which lies at the juncture of criminology, sociology of knowledge, and cultural or cross-cultural studies, and asks whether significances other than those apparent on the surface govern perceptions as they concern organized crime and immigrant illegality. It describes the fascination of the American press with all newly-emerging criminal enterprises and asks several functionalist questions concerning the possible ramifications of this interest.

Chicago's two Chinatowns, one south, the other north, are secular, highly insulated communities where close-mouthed secrecy prevails. Behind the pleasing facade of Asian restaurants, bakeries, herbal medicine drug stores, fresh produce markets and gift shops pandering to neighborhood residents and out-of-towners, street gang investigators in the past few years, have been tracking a major heroin trafficking rings involving the importation of multiple kilos of heroin brought into the neighborhood for resale on the street. These incidents underscore the ever evolving, ever changing face of organized crime in Chicago and elsewhere - the rise of Asian street gangs.

http://www.csis-scrs.gc.ca/eng/miscdocs/200007_e.html
Improvements in transportation, computer and communications technology have made the world today much smaller than it was 50 years ago. Intercontinental travel which used to require days or weeks now takes place in hours. The formerly daunting notion of conversing or conducting business with someone halfway around the globe is now a mouse-click or a telephone call away. This globalization has created a world virtually devoid of national borders. Unfortunately, these changes have also made it easier for members of highly sophisticated and organized criminal syndicates to pursue a complex web of lucrative legal and illegal activities worldwide.

A report by the United Kingdom National Criminal Intelligence Service on organized crime. (Last checked 06/15/04) United Kingdom Threat Assessment, 2001, Second Edition
http://www.ncis.co.uk/threat_assessment.html
This report gives a picture of serious criminal activity with organized crime groups (OCGs) involved in a diverse range of crime sectors, with the aim 'first and foremost to make money'. As well as traditional high-profile crimes such as drug-trafficking, robberty, extortion, theft and fraud, there is increasing concern over intellectual property theft (IPT) -- both in its own right and contributing to other criminality. The report draws attention to the sheer scale and complexity of counterfeiting -- especially of consumer goods - whether they are manufctured in the UK or in the cheap labor markets of the Far East. While UK Conterfeiting is often perceived as an activity by low level criminals, counterfeiting is, in fact, highly profitalbe and has a hevy involvement by organized criminals in the 'production, buying, importing and distribution of all types of counterefeited products'. The other misperception is that counterfeiting does not merit priority attention by law enforcement agencies but the report highlights that "the profits from IPT can help OCGs to become more established and to fund other various criminal activities'.

Contents:
{Background}
The International Crime Problem
International Training
Interagency Working Group
Legal Attache Program
Grave crime is no longer bound by the constraints of borders. Such offenses as terrorism, nuclear smuggling, organized crime, computer crime, and drug trafficking can spill over from other countries into the United States. Regardless of origin, these and other overseas crimes impact directly on our citizens and our economy. We have developed a variety of anti-crime efforts both here and abroad to combat these dangerous threats. This effort has been undertaken with the support of the President, Attorney General Janet Reno, and Secretary Warren Christopher. One of the most effective ways to fight international crime is by building cop-to-cop bridges between American law enforcement and our overseas counterparts. Without these relationships, there cannot be the commonality of purpose and open communication required for success. More and more of these bridges are being built, and successes are flowing from them. We are using a number of approaches to develop cooperative law enforcement programs with other countries. For example, our Legal Attache Program works closely with a large number of foreign police forces. Not only do they cooperate on specific cases, but our Legal Attaches -- who are highly-skilled senior FBI Agents -- also form a sort of distant early warning system to alert us to new and emerging crime threats. Another very powerful tool is training: the FBI places a high priority on assisting our foreign law enforcement counterparts through training courses here and abroad. And just a year ago, we took a major cooperative step with other Federal agencies and other foreign nations with the creation of the International Law Enforcement Academy in Budapest. These and other programs combine to help give the FBI the critical foundation needed to effectively combat international crime. There is also another vital factor: I want to thank this Committee for its crucial recognition of the importance of these issues and for your support in meeting the crime challenges from abroad. This is a rare opportunity to extend the Rule of Law while mobilizing law enforcement to meet the explosion of international crime against America. I am exceedingly grateful for the support Congress has given us and pledge to continue to work with Congress as we develop a stronger global network of effective law enforcement. Your support of law enforcement training at the Department of State has been critical to the success of our programs. The International Crime Problem
The political, social, and economic changes occurring in Eastern Europe and in the former Soviet Republics have provided significant, unintended opportunities for organized crime groups and criminal enterprises in these countries to expand internationally. Evidence that organized crime activity from these areas is expanding and will continue to expand to the United States is well-documented. These criminal enterprises are not a new phenomenon to Russia. They existed under Communism. Appropriate legal tools were not created to control organized crime and corruption activities. When Communism declined in the Soviet Union, the organized crime groups quickly expanded their influence in the emerging move toward Capitalism, again because sufficient constraints and law enforcement tools were not present. The FBI has many years of successful investigative and prosecutorial experience in the battle with La Cosa Nostra and other organized crime groups here in the United States. We view organized crime as a continuing criminal conspiracy having a firm organizational structure, a conspiracy fed by fear and corruption. This definition can also be applied to the organized crime threat facing Russia and many other countries. Members of a typical Russian organized crime group are found at every level of society. Organized crime activity in Russia includes monetary speculation, manipulation of the banking system, and embezzlement of state property, as well as contract murder, extortion, drug trafficking, prostitution, protection rackets, and infiltration of legitimate business activity. To make matters worse, a number of Russian/Eurasian organized crime groups and criminal enterprises presently operate in the U.S. Many of these criminal enterprises active in the U.S. have demonstrated a willingness to work in close concert with other non-Russian/non-Eurasian organized crime groups. The United States and Russia fully realize the need for joint cooperation against crimes that harm both countries -- and other parts of the world as well. That is the reason the FBI has opened a Legal Attache Office in Moscow to work closely with Russian police against a variety of costly crimes. From July 1994 to the present, the number of cases worked by the FBI Agents in Moscow has increased from 20 to over 200. If Congress agrees, and with the cooperation of the Department of State and the Department of Justice, we hope to expand our network of Legal Attache Offices around the world. The global needs are great -- and many nations, including Russia, are working diligently to fight crime that hurts the law-abiding everywhere. One of the specific issues of great concern to the FBI and to Russian authorities is the theft and diversion of nuclear materials -- and the potential theft of nuclear weapons by terrorists or rogue nations. Over the past year, legitimate concerns have been raised by the apparent vulnerability of radioactive materials to theft or diversion in several areas of Eastern Europe and Eurasia. The seizure of significant amounts of cesium in Lithuania and the seizure of uranium in the Czech Republic are examples of the concerns in the international community regarding the threat of nuclear proliferation. The recent increases in radiological-nuclear material incidents throughout the world have caused the international law enforcement community to communicate better with each other. Although there have been no seizures of nuclear material in the United States, two recent cases involved conspiracies to import radioactive material into this country. In New York, the U.S. Customs Service arrested foreign nationals attempting to negotiate the sale of radioactive zirconium metal into the U.S. Ultimately, 45 tons of the material were seized in Cyprus, enroute to the U.S. In the other case, the Canadian Customs Service intercepted radioactive isotopes originating in Russia being smuggled into the U.S. through Canada. The FBI assisted the Canadian law enforcement agencies in their investigation. While some crime problems flow from East to West, others flow back from West to East. One of the most difficult law enforcement problems facing many of the newly-freed and Eastern European nations is drug trafficking. The scourge of drug trafficking has had a devastating impact on the entire global community. Russia, the Newly Independent States and Eastern Europe are certainly not immune to this epidemic. Criminal organizations in these emerging democracies are taking advantage of the relaxed borders and improved telecommunications systems that have emerged in recent years to facilitate their illegitimate operations. These countries are targets of opportunity for the major drug trafficking organizations, like the Colombian cartels, which seek to establish new and lucrative markets. International Training
The FBI's international approach in combating Russian and other international organized crime groups includes general and specialized law enforcement training for foreign law enforcement agencies. During Fiscal Year (FY) 1995, the FBI trained 4,400 foreign law enforcement personnel. This training is particularly critical with respect to the police agencies of some of the newly-emerging democracies. Most of this training is accomplished by funding generously made available by Congress to the Department of State through the Freedom Support Act (FSA) and Support for Eastern European Democracies (SEED) funding. The FBI and the Department of State, working together, are also responsible for the International Law Enforcement Training Academy in Budapest, which functions as the center for law enforcement training for officers from many Eastern European, Russian and Eurasian nations. The Academy at Budapest provides an eight-week professional development program similar to our FBI National Academy Program at Quantico. During FY 1995, a total of three classes graduated from the Budapest Academy -- each of 33 mid- level police officers. Those officers came from the Czech Republic, Hungary, Latvia, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Estonia, and Lithuania. For FY 1996, the schedule is much more aggressive, calling for approximately 200 persons to be trained from the following countries: Albania, Belarus, Bulgaria, Croatia, Estonia, Hungary, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Latvia, Macedonia, Moldova, Poland, Russia, Slovenia, and Ukraine. We can be immensely proud of the Academy at Budapest. It is a direct outgrowth of our trip to Eastern Europe in 1994 and President Clinton's direction to U.S. Government agencies to join together to build the world's capabilities in fighting international crime. The Academy represents the combined efforts of the Department of State (DOS), the Department of Justice (DOJ), the FBI, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), the United States Secret Service (USSS), the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center (FLETC), the Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms (ATF), and other agencies and countries. It is truly a case where all of these law enforcement agencies are working together as partners toward a common goal. I cannot speak highly enough about the contributions ATF, DEA, Secret Service, IRS and the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center in the Department of Treasury have made in making the Academy succeed. The Academy brings together seasoned investigators as instructors and law enforcement officers from across Eastern Europe, Russia, and the Newly Independent States to learn policing under the Rule of Law. I am especially grateful to our host country, Hungary. Just last week, I along with my other counterparts from the United States were honored to attend the dedication of the International Law Enforcement Academy. With the recent completion of renovations, the capacity of the Academy has been expanded. The dedication was an historic moment in international law enforcement. The FBI also is involved in foreign police training in many other valuable ways. For example, in FY 1995, the FBI performed a total of 10 In-Country Training Needs Assessments. It works this way: at the invitation of the host government, we analyze that country's police training needs and capabilities. We then make a recommendation of how we believe we can best assist the host country's law enforcement capabilities through specifically targeted training. The assessments were conducted in Albania, Belarus, Bulgaria, Estonia, India, Kazakhstan, Kyrgystan, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova, Paraguay, Peru, Poland, Romania, Tunisia, Ukraine, and Uruguay. Through the FBI's In-Country Training Program, the FBI conducts one and two-week schools in foreign nations which concentrate on police operations and technical skills. We use seasoned, senior FBI street Agent instructors who use their extensive practical experience in training our foreign counterparts in policing under the Rule of Law. The instructors in these programs have an established expertise in criminal investigations, especially organized crime and white collar crime. Their credibility is not only essential for effective instruction but also is very effective in building the cop-to-cop bridges that we so critically need. Since the first of the year, we have trained 212 officers of the Ministry of Interior for the Russian Federation (MVD) in seminars held in Russia and at the FBI Academy in Quantico. Along with the instruction geared to the investigation of crimes, we have provided training in ethics and internal police controls -- the first time that this has ever been done and an area which is critical to the success of policing under the Rule of Law. Our In-Country Training Programs are primarily funded through the FSA and SEED funds we receive from the Department of State. The FBI, along with other law enforcement agencies, submit proposed international training plans to the Department of State at the beginning of the Fiscal Year. Depending on the funding that is available for law enforcement training, the Department of State then determines the funding amounts for each agency. During the past two years, the FBI has received $8.3 million of these funds for our training initiative. We have been very pleased with the support we have received from the Department of State -- all the training we have proposed has been funded. In addition, the FBI has used $300,000 of its appropriated funding to provide limited training to law enforcement in other countries. In FY 1995, the FBI provided FSA and SEED supported training seminars to over 1,800 law enforcement officers from Hungary, Poland, Slovakia, Czech Republic, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Ukraine, Russia, Romania, and Moldova. In FY 1996, we will expand our training into Belarus, Slovenia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgystan, Bulgaria, and Albania. The training provided is tailored to meet the needs of the participants. Topics addressed include bank robbery, drug trafficking, kidnapping, financial crimes, white-collar crime, organized crime and terrorism. Just recently, for example, we conducted a white-collar crime and corruption seminar in Kazakhstan. All of this training has a direct impact on United States persons and corporations who have flocked to these countries in search of business opportunities. In addition to the training funded by the FSA and SEED Acts, the FBI trained an additional 2,600 students through our other programs. These programs included the crime-specific investigative seminars, targeted crime scene analysis training as provided by our forensic experts, and management training for mid-level and executive law enforcement officers. Last year, 110 international officers also participated in the FBI National Academy program at Quantico. Their participation allows an additional "bridge" to be built from our state and local officers to those overseas. One beneficial part of this training is the opportunity it provides the trainers and the trainees to interact about specific crime problems being encountered in their countries, how to address the problem, share experiences learned in the process and forge new relationships for future cooperation on matters of mutual interest and concern. In some of our investigations, the FBI has benefitted by bringing actual case investigators to the U.S. from other nations to work side by side with FBI Agents. This is a continuation of the training we have provided and allows "hands-on" application and observation of investigative techniques successfully employed by the FBI in our organized crime investigations. As examples of the successes the FBI has seen from contacts and liaison established as a result of this training, a Central European working group on international organized crime and a six-nation working group on international organized crime were established this past year. In addition to the FBI, they bring together law enforcement agencies from Eastern and Western Europe and Canada to discuss specific organized crime threats common to all countries represented. Lines of communication and working relationships are now established and practical law enforcement approaches to the organized crime problems of the regions are planned. As a direct result of this initiative, several countries were, for the first time, able to establish continuing liaison communications with other represented organizations on a direct professional level and to initiate joint investigations. For example, a multi-national, case-specific fraud seminar was conducted by the FBI's Financial Crimes Section from February 18-22, 1996, in Berlin, Germany. The program dealt with bank failures and brought together investigators from the United States, Latvia, Netherlands, Russia, and Germany for a practical case training initiative. The resulting product of these constructive meetings is an investigative organized crime task force, international in scope, that is targeting significant criminal organizations determined to be a major threat to many nations, including the United States. The FBI also presented a nuclear non-proliferation conference at the FBI complex at Quantico, Virginia from April 18-21, 1995, and twenty-eight (28) SEED and FSA nations sent representatives, including, among others, Russia and Ukraine. The conference outlined the problems of nuclear materials and weapons proliferation from the countries of the former Soviet Union and counter-proliferation proposals and training initiatives. The conference is included as a FSA initiative to address this serious problem. The Department of Defense and the FBI are currently in the final stages of submitting the DOD/FBI Counterproliferation Program report to Congress regarding plans to provide international training seminars on nuclear smuggling. This is part of our Nunn-Lugar funded international training seminars program on nuclear smuggling. The FBI's Nuclear Biological Chemical Proliferation Unit is presently in possession of a report compiled by an FBI team that recently conducted a training assessment in the Czech Republic. During this assessment, which was coordinated by our Legal Attache in Vienna, the FBI representatives from the International Coordination Unit, the FBI Laboratory and the Engineering Section, met with various Czech law enforcement agencies, Czech nuclear safety officials, and faculty members of the Rez Institute. This assessment yielded valuable information regarding the concerns and needs of the attending Czech officials. It is proposed that the information provided by the Czechs, with regard to their specific requirements, will result in establishing a training prototype for other countries requesting support in counterproliferation matters. Interagency Working Group
As this Committee is fully aware, the Congress established the Interagency Working Group (IWG) to make recommendations as to training and other support received by Russia, the Newly Independent States, and other Eastern European countries. This has been a successful endeavor that greatly assists us in the proper coordination of our training efforts abroad. The IWG allows all Federal law enforcement agencies to participate in Department of State FSA and SEED funded training initiatives within the former Soviet Union and Bloc nations, based on their respective law enforcement jurisdiction. Participation in the IWG prevents duplication and waste of resources. IWG priorities are formulated by the Departments of State, Justice and the Treasury, as dictated by the various law enforcement entities from those departments, participating on the IWG. The FBI participates as a member of the IWG in carrying out the programs under the auspices of the FSA and SEED. Let me describe the FBI's role: The FBI, as the agency with the broadest Federal law enforcement responsibility, conducted a major portion of the training and technical assistance during FY 1995, with a similar schedule planned for FY 1996. The FBI has exclusive training in the area of organized crime. Other participating agencies like the Drug Enforcement Administration and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms, likewise have exclusive areas of training based on their expertise and jurisdiction. In other areas, such as economic crimes, training by the United States Secret Service, U.S. Customs Service, FINCEN, and DEA compliments that done by the FBI. Legal Attache Program
The FBI's Legal Attache Program is the single most significant factor in the Bureau's ability to detect, deter, and investigate international crimes in which the United States or our citizens are the victims. By stationing Agents abroad and establishing operational links with foreign police, the FBI substantially expands the nation's perimeter of law enforcement protection. Generously funded out of the Commerce, State, and Justice Bill, the FBI's Legal Attaches are truly our first line of defense. International crime has grown enormously in recent years. Technological advances and the end of the Cold War prompted dramatic increases in global travel and telecommunications. Criminals have used these changes to their advantage, diffusing their operations around the world to avoid law enforcement scrutiny. The relentless globalization of crime threatens America both at home and abroad -- and all other law-abiding nations as well. For better or for worse, the global village is now a late-20th century reality. Our experience shows that placing FBI Agents at critical posts abroad provides the most reliable, effective and timely means to combat international crime -- and often at the source. It is essential to station highly-skilled agents in other countries to prevent foreign terrorism and foreign crime from reaching the United States. At present, the FBI has in place in our Legal Attache Offices 70 senior Agents and 54 support personnel in 23 nations around the world, funded out of FBI operational funds. During FY 1995, these offices handled over 11,200 matters. They are the conduit through which law enforcement information and cooperation flows between the United States and its foreign partners. Their goal can be defined succinctly: to keep foreign crime as far from American shores as possible, to keep foreign crime permanently at bay whenever possible, to help combat more effectively those crimes that do reach our borders. The whole point is to protect the American people from harm. FBI Agents stationed overseas are not intelligence officers; they are not a shadow intelligence agency; and they do not engage in espionage. They are law enforcement Agents-- dedicated to fighting organized crime, terrorism, nuclear smuggling, violent crime, drug trafficking, and economic crime. Let me give a few examples of the direct benefits made possible because our agents are overseas and have the cop-to-cop relationships with host authorities critical to effective law enforcement. For over 15 years, FBI Agents in Rome have had a close working relationship with all the major Italian police services. Through one joint investigation which began in 1991, it was determined that members of the Sicilian Mafia, Camorra, and 'Ndrangheta were collaborating with the Colombian drug cartels in shipments of cocaine to Italy and heroin into New York. In that investigation -- which utilized sophisticated investigative techniques, including electronic surveillance -- the FBI worked closely with the Italian police services, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, and Colombian judicial authorities. As a result of our combined efforts, 89 people were arrested in the United States, Italy, Canada, and Colombia. Since their arrests, 30 of these people have been convicted in the United States alone. Kobi Mowatt, a fugitive from the United States, was recently arrested in Tanzania with assistance from our FBI Legal Attaches. Mowatt, an alleged member of the notoriously violent "First and Kennedy Street Crew," from Washington, D.C., is charged with conspiring to participate in a racketeering organization by committing acts of murder, robbery, kidnapping, and drug dealing. He was charged in a 53-count indictment with participating in four homicides, including a triple murder here in Washington in 1994. With direct assistance from our Legal Attaches, and the considerable assistance of foreign police agencies, the FBI was able to track Mowatt through Russia until his capture in Tanzania. Last month, he was brought back to the United States to stand trial. In a major move against a growing Russian organized crime structure in the United States, the FBI last year arrested Vyacheslav Kirillovich Ivankov, allegedly one of the most powerful Russian crime leaders in this country, along with five of his associates on Federal charges of conspiracy to commit extortion. The arrests in New York followed an intensive FBI investigation that was aided greatly by the Russian Ministry of Interior and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and made possible because of our Legal Attaches and the relationships that have flowed from cooperation abroad. The arrest was based upon Federal arrest warrants which charge a total of nine individuals. According to Russian law enforcement authorities, Ivankov formed a substantial criminal organization in Russia before he entered the United States allegedly to manage and control Russian organized crime activities in this country. Russian organized crime groups use businesses in the former Soviet Union, Western and Central Europe, and the United States to serve as fronts for laundering the proceeds of illegal activities and for conducting highly profitable commerce in goods in the successor states of the Soviet Union, known as the Commonwealth of Independent States. In November 1994, several of the defendants allegedly began to extort several million dollars from American and Russian businesses. Intelligence information was shared on a continuing basis among the FBI, the Russian MVD and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. FBI Legat participation was critical. Last August, Eyad Ismail was apprehended abroad and brought back to New York to face an indictment charging him with taking part in the terrorist bombing of the World Trade Center that killed six people and injured over 1,000. As the complaint alleged, Ismail fled the United States the night of the bombing. He was taken into custody after an extensive investigation greatly facilitated by an FBI Legal Attache. Last April, Ramzi Yousef and Abdul Hakim Murad were indicted in New York for a conspiracy and attempt to bomb United States commercial airlines serving air routes in the Far East. The indictment alleges that as part of the conspiracy, Yousef placed a bomb in a foreign airliner that exploded and killed one passenger. Yousef was already facing charges relating to the bombing of the World Trade Center in New York. With critical assistance from FBI Legal Attaches, Yousef was tracked to Pakistan, apprehended, and extradited to the United States to stand trial. Murad was identified and likewise extradited to the United States. Both await trial. Most recently, four Russians were charged in New York for conspiring to defraud 24 Russian companies, including a charity established to aid the victims of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster, of approximately $10.8 million. Many other important cases have been made possible only because the FBI Legal Attaches are able to freely work with our foreign counterparts toward the mutually-shared goal of effective law enforcement under the Rule of Law. The FBI is deeply grateful to Congress for the support and contributions for our Legal Attache Program. A relatively few Agents beyond our borders make a contribution out of proportion to their small numbers and the modest amount of dollars spent. As part of the FY 1996 Appropriations process, our Appropriations Subcommittees have asked us to prepare a plan reflecting our assessment of both the short and long-term Legal Attache expansion needs. We have been working closely with the Departments of Justice and State to provide Congress with a carefully thought-out plan designed to better meet the challenges we face from exploding international crime and terrorism. This plan -- which is under final administrative review -- is a realistic, down-to-earth assessment of the vast changes that have occurred in recent years in the world, especially in Europe with the breakup of the former Soviet Union. I am most grateful to our House and Senate Committees for their leadership. Quite candidly, Congress has taken planning for FBI Legal Attache Offices out of the choppy one-year cycle and prompted us to develop a long-term, comprehensive response to a rapidly changing and worsening international crime situation. Once completed, I am looking forward to discussing the plan with Congress. I am extraordinarily grateful for the support Congress has given these programs. In my view, this represents capitalizing on a rare opportunity to protect our citizens by being both prepared and sufficiently aggressive as crime moves into the global arena. At the same time, I wish to thank the Department of State and Secretary Christopher for supporting the FBI's foreign police training efforts and for their leadership on the IWG. Since my trip to Moscow and Eastern Europe in 1994 we have had an ongoing and productive dialogue about our training initiatives -- indeed, an extraordinary partnership has formed. In addition to Secretary Christopher, Deputy Secretary Strobe Talbott, former Assistant Secretary Richard Holbrooke, Ambassador Robert Gelbard, U.S. Ambassador to Hungary Donald Blinken, and many others -- both here and abroad -- have been instrumental in promoting these programs.

GLOBAL ORGANIZED CRIME AS A THREAT TO NATIONAL SECURITY
Global Organized Crime in the Post-Cold War Era
Since the end of the Cold War and the subsequent refocusing of Intelligence away from the Soviet Union, Global Organized Crime has been recognized as a priority threat to national security. Global Organized Crime has been defined by FBI Director Louis J. Freeh as "a continuing criminal conspiracy having a firm organizational structure, a conspiracy fed by fear and corruption." The international crimes that extend over foreign borders and into the United States include drug trafficking, extortion, money laundering, arms smuggling, bribery, and fraud schemes. In recent years these criminal groups have dramatically increased the scope of their activities by taking advantage of many Post-Cold War opportunities such as the lowering of economic and political barriers; the end of communist regimes and the founding of fragile new democracies; the increase in legitimate international trade; and the advances in technology that facilitate global communication and transport. The Administration, Intelligence and Law Enforcement have reacted to the new organized crime groups, emerging on a global scale after the Cold War, by creating a strong national response. The current system is not "broken." However, the threat itself is growing in terms of its scale and complexity at a such a fast rate that it is important to look at possible ways in which the national response to Global Organized Crime can be improved. In order to understand the significance of improving current policy and national efforts against Global Organized Crime, the changing nature and seriousness of the threat must first be understood. The Changing Threats
Emerging threats vs. Familiar problems
Global Organized Crime in the Post-Cold War Era pose some familiar national security threats and some threats that United States did not previously have to address. The security concerns that existed during the Cold War include: political instability of foreign governments, international drug trafficking and arms transfers to hostile parties. Global criminal leaders present new puzzles within these familiar threats. Former Director of the CIA, R. James Woolsey, described the difficulties of applying traditional national security methods when addressing Global Organized Crime, ...the tools of diplomacy are ineffective and irrelevant in dealing directly with these criminal groups. Even under the most difficult, intractable period of the Cold War, if consensus was not possible, communication was, nevertheless, feasible. Not so in the world of organized crime. Although we do negotiate with our key allies and friends to better attack the problem, there is no negotiating table where we can try to work out a compromise or reach a consensus with criminals.... In addition, certain distinctions can be made between Global Organized Crime and terrorism. While many terrorist groups that engage in violent acts are motivated by specific political causes, such as Egyptian Islamic Fundamentalist terrorists who use violent means to protest their country's current government and Western influences, most organized crime groups are only interested in political power for the security it would provide their organization and are primary motived by money. The international economic threat, posed by Global Organized Crime, in an increasingly global economy is among the major "new" threats to national security. The major economic powers and the less developed nations did not previously share a collective problem of this nature. Global Organized Crime does not just affect a select group of financial institutions or regional areas, it affects international financial networks and economies at a national level. These threats present new conflicts that will require innovative strategies in the future. Global Cooperation among Organized Crime Groups Cooperation among Global Organized Crime groups has increased as restrictions have lessened between international borders. These foreign havens for criminals and their assets have made it increasingly difficult for Law Enforcement to trace illegal profits; gather evidence on the criminal leaders; and identify and contain criminal groups. When Law Enforcement activities in Florida reduced the amount of Colombian cocaine being smuggled into the U.S. through the Carribean islands, the Colombian drug cartel leaders simply began working with their Mexican counterparts instead of their Carribean partners. Another example of an international partnership is Columbian drug lords selling methamphetamine to American dealers in the U.S., the ingredients for which were produced through Colombian connections to organized crime in Europe, Asia and the Far East. These global networks allow organized crime groups to greatly increase the profits of their operations and their methods of evading local governments as they share information, skills, costs, market access and relative strengths. Threat to Global Economy
Transnational organized crime groups pose more of a threat to international financial markets as the world economy becomes increasingly interdependent. Laundering billions of dollars in organized crime money worsens national debt problems because the large sums of money are then lost as tax revenue to that country's government. Russian organized crime groups are actively involved in banking, according to FBI official James Moody, because public financial institutions are "the most vulnerable and lucrative target." The Russian Interior Ministry has estimated that organized crime "controls" most of Russia's 200 banks and half of its financial capital ("control" ranges from ownership and operation to influence over bank decisions through threats of violence). U.S. and Western businesses in Russia, in particular, are frequent targets of extortion, robberies, threats and murder. Security costs for these businesses (especially physical protection, extra protection of cargo, and forced payments to gangsters for "protection,") often consume more than 30% of profits. The fear generated combined with organized crime monopolies in certain industries, such as the agriculture and construction markets in Columbia and Venezuela, damages the overall economy because it discourages legitimate, innovative businesses and entrepreneurs (foreign and domestic) from entering the market. Political Impact
Global Organized Crime can have a damaging effect on political structures, especially the fragile new systems of government found in the former communist or totalitarian regimes. South American drug cartels have a destabilizing effect on governments through their financial support of local guerilla rebels, such as the Sendero Luminoso in Peru and the Revolutionary Armed Forces in Columbia, who share their animosity toward the government and who exchange protection for money and arms supplies. The Sicilian Mafia have used their economic power over local businesses and banks and their supplies of cash to corrupt politicians, judges and Law Enforcement, assassinating many of those public figures who will not cooperate. Media polls indicate that the many Russians believe the "mafiya" is more powerful than the government. As people feel that the government is powerless to stop organized crime, they turn to crime leaders for protection and political institutions begin to deteriorate. Fear of organized crime undermines the credibility of political reform and may encourage support for anti-democratic, hardline politicians such as Russia's Vladimir Zhirinovsky who promised during the 1993 campaign to end organized crime in 3 months through mass arrest and execution. The Potential for a Major Nuclear/Arms Theat The global networks of criminals, terrorists and corrupt government officials and their complex methods of smuggling goods could easily be transferred to the smuggling of nuclear materials on a massive scale. While Global Organized Crime has become increasingly more involved in the transfer of arms, encouraged in part by conflicts in the Balkans and former Soviet Union which proved to be profitable for the Russian and Italian mafia, the smuggling of nuclear materials seems to be currently isolated to select incidents and mostly to amateurs. Russia no longer has the nuclear materials protection that it had during the Cold War when materials were controlled by a tight, centralized system under a politically powerful government. In the past year, the FBI has seized major shipments of nuclear materials in Eastern Europe, including large seizures of cesium in Lithuania and uranium in the Czech Republic. As Global Organized Crime groups become more powerful and as nuclear materials become more vulnerable (through poor management, underpaid desperate workers in the nuclear facilities, and government corruption) the threat becomes more serious. Damage to Society caused by International Drug Trafficking International drug trafficking poses a threat to the social fabric of all countries. The increase in the scale of these operations has led to an increase in drug use, addiction, and general crime level. The common U.S.-Mexico border alone causes a tremendous increase in the American drug problem: 60-70% of cocaine in the U.S. enters at this border through a Mexican-Columbian organized crime partnership. Other European organized crime groups use this border to transport heroin, marijuana, and methamphetamine. It is becoming increasingly difficult to track the flow of narcotics into the United States as the drug cartel methods become more technically sophisticated: redesigning the interiors of Boeing 727s to hold maximum amounts of cocaine; transferring drug profits electronically to dozens of banks around the world in less than 24 hours; and using falsified export documents and invoices for goods in order to disguise drug trafficking transactions. THE CURRENT NATIONAL RESPONSE TO GLOBAL ORGANIZED CRIME
The Administration
President Clinton and the current administration have acknowledged the threat of Global Organized Crime by supporting new anti-crime legislation and by highlighting the issue in public forums. Reducing transnational crime, according to President Clinton, is a part of the challenge of "making sure America remains the strongest force in the world for peace and freedom, security and prosperity" as it enters the 21st century. Presidential Decision Directive-42 (PDD-42), created by President Clinton, recognizes that Global Organized Crime is a threat to national security. The directive orders government agencies to "use creatively and aggressively all legal means to combat international organized crime,"creates the authority to deny visas to a broad range of organized criminals, and sanctions authority against governments that cooperate with or provide sanctuary to organized crime figures. While PDD- 42 brought public attention to the issue of international organized crime, it did not expand or change current policy. President Clinton merely highlighted the topic with PDD-42 and repeated older policy. In comparison, PDD-35 may prove to have a significant effect on the threat because it will affect the amount of Intelligence resources devoted to global crime. PDD- 35, which defines intelligence requirements, declares that intelligence collection and analysis of international criminal and drug activities should be a high priority. The President has also actively supported the International Crime Control Act of 1996 which addresses Global Organized Crime with measures that include expanding the definitions of money laundering, eliminating the statute of limitations for all federal criminal offenses committed outside of the United States and encourages global cooperation among governments through joint-law enforcement programs. The Act will provide U.S. Law Enforcement with a little more flexibility overseas in their investigations and arrests of international criminals. It is possible for the President to lead a government-wide initiative against a new security threat. In the late 1940's, the U.S. developed a strategy for containing Soviet sponsored communism. This unified plan of action included the Marshall Plan, military build-up, development of long-standing alliances (especially NATO), public diplomacy efforts to rebuild foreign democracies and the focusing of the Intelligence Community on the problem. The Post-Cold War Era has a different world context, but the successful strategy can still serve as a model for intergovernmental cooperation. Law Enforcement and Intelligence
Different Perspectives on Global Organized Crime
Containing organized crime traditionally has been the domain of law enforcement agencies while addressing national security concerns has been primarily the field of the Intelligence Community. Transnational crime blurs the line between "domestic" and "foreign" affairs because the criminals have a global impact: they are based in foreign countries, but have international ties, including many in the United States. The Law Enforcement perspective on Global Organized Crime is that it is a major cause in the increasing domestic and international crime levels. Law Enforcement seeks to reduce global crime through arrests and successful prosecutions of the international organized crime leaders. The Intelligence perspective examines global crime in terms of its political and economic impact overseas and as a threat to national security. Intelligence agencies pursue information on Global Organized Crime that will assist Law Enforcement in their investigations but are primarily concerned with providing policy-makers with global crime intelligence. The differing perspectives on Global Organized Crime reveals larger differences between Law Enforcement and Intelligence. Since the Law Enforcement mission is to enforce the law and provide information to court trials that will establish proof beyond a reasonable doubt, they are acutely sensitive to evidentiary requirements when collecting information. Intelligence agencies, because of their mission to provide policy-makers with relevant national security intelligence, collect information for their own analysis and are more concerned with preserving their sources than placing them under the public scrutiny of trials. Generations of Law Enforcement and Intelligence officials working for different missions have resulted in a mutual distrust of working together; while Intelligence worries about protecting its sources and methods when assisting a criminal investigation, Law Enforcement is concerned about protecting their evidence. The Law Enforcement Approach
The Department of Justice seeks to reduce Global Organized Crime by presenting a strong Law Enforcement presence overseas. In recent years, FBI Legal Attache offices alone have grown to 70 Senior Agents in 23 countries. The Legal Attache program works closely with foreign police on specific cases and acts as a "distant early warning system" to alert the FBI of emerging crime threats. Director Freeh has focused on "building cop-to-cop bridges between American law enforcement and our overseas counterparts" and views this as being the most effective means of fighting international crime. The FBI programs in the U.S. and overseas that train foreign law enforcement officers are a central element of this partnership. The model for global cooperation through training is the recent creation of the International Law Enforcement Academy in Budapest. Although the FBI has been successful in building an increasingly extensive network of police force partnerships, the Law Enforcement approach to Global Organized Crime does have its limitations. Director Freeh has suggested that "such international law enforcement problems are not solved by merely an intelligence community response. It is not a matter of spy- counterspy. Instead, it requires a law enforcement response..." Despite Director Freeh's persuasive arguments, there are certain obstacles for a law enforcement response. Collecting evidence beyond a reasonable doubt in Global Organized Crime cases is more difficult because the international networks allow criminals to hide their tracks in different bank accounts, partners, and storage areas around the world. The overall effectiveness of prosecuting these criminals is also questionable in cases when a crime leader is brought to trial, and his organization simply promotes a different criminal to that position in order to continue with its operations. The Intelligence Approach
As part of its new role addressing non-traditional threats of the Post-Cold War Era, Intelligence makes contributions of Global Organized Crime information to Law Enforcement and policy-makers. Former DCI John Deutch redirected the Intelligence Community's resources and activities toward assisting Law Enforcement to "identify, target and apprehend" criminals engaged in illegal trafficking and smuggling. The CIA has reorganized the Director of Central Intelligence's Counter-Narcotics Center into the DCI Crime and Narcotics Center. The new center has tried to provide greater opportunities for law enforcement agencies to gain "actionable intelligence" on specific global crime groups. According to David Carey, Director of the DCI Crime and Narcotics Center, intelligence collection has been primarily directed at the structure of international crime networks and the political and economic impact of the threat. HUMINT (Human-Source Intelligence) has proven to be the most effective Intelligence discipline in collecting information on global crime. In SIRs prepared at the request of the DCI and under the auspices of the National Intelligence Council, HUMINT was graded as being critically more important for narcotics intelligence than all other intelligence disciplines put together. The global networks of organized crime groups interacting with other criminal groups, terrorists and corrupt officials, are not easily observed using the technical methods that were successfully employed for national security concerns during the Cold War. They can, however, be penetrated by human sources. Human agents, through their internal access to the criminal groups, provide information on future dangers and weaknesses of the criminal networks, and without the use of covert action, disrupt and isolate international criminal groups by allowing Intelligence to place them under intense scrutiny. Although the National Security Act of 1947 prohibits the CIA from having domestic Law Enforcement powers, the CIA continues to be involved in Global Organized Crime cases that have domestic elements. Many transnational criminals have connections to American citizens and operate parts of their organization in the United States. For example, over 200 of Russia's estimated 6000 organized crime groups operate with American counterparts in 17 U.S. cities spread out across 14 states. Reagan's Executive Order 12333 clarifies CIA statutory authority in this area by authorizing the CIA to "participate in law enforcement activities to investigate or prevent clandestine intelligence activities by foreign powers or international terrorist or narcotics activity." Cooperation with Law Enforcement allows the CIA to remain active in cases with domestic elements. The CIA, under E.O. 12333, participates in the international aspects of the global crime case and Law Enforcement then handles the domestic aspects that involve U.S. citizens or other areas of domestic involvement. Cooperation Between Intelligence and Law Enforcement Problems in coordinating overseas activities between Intelligence and Law Enforcement have resulted from the greatly increasing number of overseas Justice Department agents (especially FBI), overlapping responsibilities, lack of a clear hierarchy for coordination, different missions and concerns over the risks involved in cases. Law Enforcement agencies alone have problems with inefficient overlap and interference of cases. In April 1992, five Law Enforcement agencies had duplicating analysis of drug smuggling movement by air into Mexico. There is controversy over Law Enforcement coordinating activities with the Ambassador although it is required by law to do so (22 U.S. C. 3927). Law Enforcement expresses interest in keeping the Ambassador informed of its activities but is reluctant to involve him in prosecutorial decisions. On an inconsistent basis, Law Enforcement coordinates the recruitment of confidential informants overseas with the Chief of Station. Although the Chief of Station and Law Enforcement representative are under the authority of the Embassy, there is not a clear hierarchy or set of guide-lines for coordinating activities. Since there is not a single individual or group to organize individual activities, the FBI often acts independently of Intelligence and vice versa. Intelligence and Law Enforcement, from worker to director levels of authority, have created projects to improve coordination between the communities. A special task force is trying to clarify guidelines for cooperation between Intelligence and Law Enforcement overseas. A Joint Intelligence Community-Law Enforcement (JICLE) working group (comprised of lawyers and officials from both sides) was created in 1995 and meets on a weekly basis to help devise solutions to common problems. The recommendations of the JICLE have included Intelligence- Law Enforcement training programs that overcome mission and community culture barriers through education on the laws, regulations, and procedures that facilitate coordination. The new Transnational Threats Committee of the NSC, which includes the DCI and the Attorney General, provides the first formal opportunity for overseas coordination problems to be solved at the highest levels of authority. Global Cooperation
Law Enforcement and Intelligence have found that international cooperation is one of the most effective solutions to transnational problems. The Law Enforcement Community has made significant advances in global cooperation through delegations of American law enforcement leaders visiting foreign counterparts, cooperative criminal investigations, and training programs for foreign Law Enforcement. The Aspin-Brown Commission found that Intelligence derived great benefit from such cooperative arrangements as: exchanging requests for collection; exchanging analysts and technicians; and assisting foreign countries to acquire collection capabilities in order to share the results of future collections. While U.S. Intelligence Community might not want to pursue a thorough "spy-to-spy" method analogous to FBI Director Freeh's "cop-to-cop" approach (due to the inherent risks to sources and methods), the IC still needs to continue global cooperation efforts. In many cases, global cooperation is worth the risk because it provides access to geography, skills, contacts and information that would be otherwise unavailable. ALTERNATIVES TO CURRENT POLICY TOWARD GLOBAL ORGANIZED CRIME
Direction from the Administration
The Aspin-Brown Commission's Preparing for the 21st Century: An Appraisal of U.S. Intelligence recommends that the President by Executive Order reaffirm that global criminal activities are national security matters and require a multi-agency response. The recommendation further suggests that "a law enforcement approach is inadequate." If implemented, this recommendation would have almost zero costs and obstacles but would create little improvement on the present situation by providing no additional funds, manpower or plans for action. The President has already recognized these issues in PDD-35, PDD-42 and through his support for the International Crime Control Act of 1996. The additional Executive Order would not contribute significantly to the reform effort. Legislative Boundaries
The Aspin-Brown Commission recommends an E.O. that would clarify that intelligence agencies with collection capabilities may collect information about non-U.S. persons outside the United States at the request of Law Enforcement. The Commission does not specify if Intelligence would participate based on its own volition and if Law Enforcement could actually task Intelligence. "Tasking," as opposed to "requesting information," would imply a certain amount of Law Enforcement control over Intelligence during the case. The recommendation would basically leave the situation as it is currently but would officially recognize the legality of Intelligence agencies collecting for Law Enforcement. There is a reluctance on the part of the Intelligence Community to accept direct collection requests from law enforcement agencies. NSA and CIA refuse to be directly tasked by Law Enforcement and will only proceed with a collection request on a specific target if they first determine that there is a "foreign intelligence" purpose. This formal requirement is often a mere procedural formality because most requests are determined to be relevant to foreign intelligence. Unfortunately, the requirement can also create tension between the two communities by fostering the perception that Intelligence is unwilling to assist Law Enforcement. Instead of the President creating an E.O., the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal year 1997( IAA97) responded to the Aspin-Brown recommendation with an amendment to the National Security Act of 1947 that clarifies Intelligence assistance to Law Enforcement. Section 105A states "elements of the intelligence community may, upon the request of a United States law enforcement agency, collect information outside the United States about individuals who are not United States persons." The careful wording still implies that Intelligence will participate based on its own volition. If it had been phrased as "Law Enforcement may request that...", it would have had slightly different connotations. As it is currently written, it follows the Aspin-Brown model, and officially authorizes the current Intelligence-Law Enforcement collection procedures without trying to significantly improve them. The amendment, as it was recommended by the Commission, will provide some benefits to Law Enforcement and Intelligence cooperation and will have little costs. The CIA and NSA will benefit by collecting for Law Enforcement with less concern about their legal authorities being questioned. Law Enforcement will benefit from a probable increase in collection requests that are answered. In evading the more controversial question of collection responsibilities and overseas tasking, the Aspin-Brown recommendation and IAA97 also had fewer implementation obstacles. The House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence's IC21: Intelligence Community in the 21st Century recommend that no additional clarifications of the law be made in terms of coordination and cooperation between Law Enforcement and Intelligence. They suggested that there is already enough flexibility and a workable set of legal boundaries in the current laws and standing Executive Orders. E.O. 12333 provides reasonably flexible boundaries for Intelligence assisting Law Enforcement in international criminal cases. Despite these arguments a clarification of the law, as the Aspin-Brown Commission recommended and IAA97 created, still provided some benefits. Lack of precise legal authorities can hamper, delay or side-track cooperation and communication efforts between the two communities. Coordination between Law Enforcement and Intelligence
Global Crime Committee The Aspin-Brown Commission, HPSCI and the Council on Foreign Relations reports agree that the Intelligence and the Law Enforcement Communities need a better mechanism for finding solutions to disagreements and for forming cohesive strategies. The Aspin-Brown Commission recommends that the President create by Executive Order a Global Crime Committee of the National Security Council to direct the U.S. actions against transnational security threats. The committee would be chaired by the National Security Advisor and the core members would include the Director of Central Intelligence, the Attorney General, and the Secretaries of State and Defense. Unfortunately, the Secretary of Treasury is not included among the core members even though his input would be important when the Committee discussed such transnational threats as financial crimes and illegal smuggling. The new committee would identify specific transnational groups that require a coordinated response; establish an overall strategy and monitor its implementation; develop improved procedures for sharing relevant information between the two communities; and develop guidelines to govern the coordination of law enforcement overseas. The recommendation for the creation of this committee is the one of the most significant efforts by the intelligence reform reports to improve the national strategy toward Global Organized Crime. Instead of the President using an Executive Order, Congress responded to the Aspin- Brown Commission's recommendation by creating the Committee on Transnational Threats, under section 804 of the Intelligence Authorization Act of FY 1997. With the exception of the committee's name and a few minor differences, the new Committee follows the model created by the Commission in their recommendation. Unlike the Transnational Threats Committee, previous Intelligence and Law Enforcement working groups, task forces and meetings were not held at a director level, and were not focused on forming a national strategy but rather on resolving individual conflicts between the communities. The Aspin-Brown recommendation succeeded in convincing the Congressional committees to create the Transnational Threat Committee but the real obstacle remains insuring that the directors actually use this opportunity to forge better cooperation instead of a superficial collaboration. The major cost of the committee is pulling already busy leaders away from other activities. The potential benefits of improving the national approach toward global crime will outweigh the costs. The Committee, as it was modeled after the Commission's recommendation, blends all international criminal threats into one label of "global crime" or "transnational threats." While some of the security and diplomacy issues are similar, Global Organized Crime and terrorist groups have different organizational networks, agendas, and weaknesses. They also pose different economic and political threats. While the Transnational Threats Committee will address both of these issues, it should be aware that strategies that are responsive to the differences in Global Organized Crime and terrorism will be more effective in reducing each threat. Single Law Enforcement Representative The Aspin-Brown Commission recommends that the President designate the Attorney General as the focal point and spokesperson for formulating the Law Enforcement strategy for global crime, facilitating cooperation with Intelligence and coordinating overseas Law Enforcement activities. Currently, Law Enforcement responsibility is split between the Attorney General (whose department includes FBI, DEA and INS) and the Secretary of Treasury (whose department includes Secret Service, Customs Service, and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms). The majority of Global Organized Crime issues fall under the Attorney General's responsibilities but Global Organized Crime cases that involve smuggling goods into the U.S., money laundering and other financial crimes, fall under the jurisdiction of the Secretary of Treasury. They should both be included in forming national strategies and in representing Law Enforcement as they direct departments with different responsibilities and resources. The additional Treasury perspective provides more significant benefits than the gain in efficiency that a single representative would provide. The HPSCI report similarly opposes the Attorney General acting as the single representative or the FBI acting as the lead agency of Law Enforcement. HPSCI argues that it would be a mistake to ignore overseas law enforcement agencies outside of the Justice Department. This is an important recommendation because while the FBI has provided innovative solutions to global crime and should continue to be active in influencing the improvement of the overall law enforcement strategy, it is not the only agency involved in overseas activities. Priority in the National Strategy and Coordination
Since effective coordination requires strong leadership, the Aspin-Brown Commission and the Council on Foreign Relations Report suggest that a coordinated national effort against global crime would benefit from Intelligence taking priority over Law Enforcement. According to the Aspin-Brown Commission, in order to coordinate daily activities overseas, Law Enforcement should play a subordinate role under the Ambassador and the Chief of Station. However, HPSCI argues against Intelligence taking immediate priority over Law Enforcement and only recommends that the Chief of Station and the Ambassador be "kept reasonably informed of law enforcement objectives and plans." While Intelligence agencies can make a significant contribution to policy-makers forming decisions on Global Organized Crime, they should not necessarily be given priority over Law Enforcement. The CFR's suggestion that Intelligence be given priority "lest pursuit of evidence or individuals for prosecution cause major foreign policy problems or complicate ongoing Intelligence and diplomatic activities" does not justify subordinating Law Enforcement. In many foreign countries, American Law Enforcement agents and their local activities are eagerly welcomed by the foreign governments who are concerned with stopping their national crime problems. There may be more distrust of American Intelligence. Since the majority of Law Enforcement cases are overt and carried out with the coordination of foreign police, there is little danger of Law Enforcement causing a "major foreign policy problem." RECOMMENDATIONS
Recommendations for the new Transnational Threats Committee:
1.This study recommends that the Committee include the Secretary of Treasury when addressing such issues as illegal smuggling and financial crimes. The agencies under the Department of Treasury, in addition to those under the Department of Justice, are actively involved in the national effort against transnational crime. Global crimes that fall under the Treasury jurisdiction include: narcotics and other contraband smuggling (U.S. Customs Service); counterfeiting American money (U.S. Secret Service); money laundering and financial crimes (Financial Crimes Enforcement Network). One obstacle to implementing this recommendation is the argument that inviting the Secretary of Treasury would be unnecessary because the Attorney General is already representing Law Enforcement in the Committee. While the departments under the Attorney General are also involved in these areas, there are some situations where Department of Treasury would be more affected and more importantly, the Committee and its national strategy would benefit from the Treasury perspective. 2.The Committee should set up a practical, working hierarchy overseas to conduct Intelligence and Law Enforcement activities under a coordinated policy. One of the stated functions of the Committee is to "develop guidelines" for coordination overseas but it is necessary to specify that the Committee needs to set up guidelines for a specific hierarchy, if coordination reforms are to be effective. There is already interest in both communities in improving coordination of activities overseas. But in actual practice, Law Enforcement often acts independently of Intelligence and vice versa because lines of authority overseas can become blurred. Problems with communication are due there not being a single person or group to lead and organize the individual activities. It is further recommended that the Chief of Station (COS) be in charge of the actual coordination of these activities. As the head of the Embassy, the Ambassador should be kept informed of both Intelligence and Law Enforcement activities but his personal involvement in the details of coordination should continue to depend on the individual Ambassador. The Committee should give the Chief of Station clear guidelines for organizing activities and the authority necessary to accomplish efficient coordination of resources. They should clearly define the COS and the Law Enforcement responsibilities to each other as well as to the Ambassador. The major obstacle could be opposition from the Attorney General and Law Enforcement officials (especially FBI) who are supportive of greater cooperation but who are rapidly increasing their activities overseas and do not want to see their freedom limited by the Chief of Station. Another concern is that unless the Committee sets up clear lines of authority, it may be difficult for the Chief of Station to coordinate activities and ensure that Law Enforcement adheres to the guidelines. 3.The Committee should form a separate proactive strategy for Global Organized Crime and Drug Trafficking Networks. The IC, in order to avoid wasting resources through duplication, must recognize the similarities between Global Organized Crime and other transnational threats. However, the different activities and potential vulnerabilities of Global Organized Crime must also be acknowledged by the Committee if it is to form an effective strategy against the threat. For example, an intelligence strategy for Global Organized Crime might focus on gathering information on the international money laundering networks. Since laundered money is necessary to continue the daily operations of these criminal networks, a concentrated multi- agency attack on the money laundering channels could be debilitating to Global Organized Crime groups and Drug Traffickers. While terrorist groups can also be involved in money laundering, this strategy may not be as successful in preventing terrorist attacks. From the other perspective, strategies used against terrorism may not prove to be as effective against organized crime. Implementing this recommendation would strengthen the national effort against Global Organized Crime by producing a coordinated strategy specific to its own concerns. The costs would be low because it would not necessarily entail devoting more resources to addressing the threat but rather using the existing resources more effectively. Certain Committee members may oppose the recommendation on the belief that it would be a waste of resources to devote the Committee and the agencies they represent to one transnational threat when they could take advantage of the similarities of the threats. However, the importance of having a "Transnational Threat" committee instead of having a "Global Organized Crime" committee already takes advantage of these similarities by pooling the leaders and resources involved in all of these threats. Within the Committee, the differences should also be recognized. 4.The Committee should create more liaison programs between Intelligence and Law Enforcement dealing with Global Organized Crime. The two communities are already participating in programs like this, but since the benefits are significant, the Committee should encourage cooperation and integration on a working level through more programs. On a case by case level, they would benefit from the different perspectives and on a higher level of authority, they would benefit from the joint programs because it would help to facilitate future cooperation. The cost of adding more joint projects is relatively small when compared with the benefits of cases that result in greater intelligence gathering/prosecutions and in less resources being used overall because manpower and technology have been shared between the communities. 5.This study recommends that the Committee make efforts to improve coordination with foreign governments. Global cooperation is necessary to fight criminal groups with increasingly interconnected networks around the world. FBI Director Freeh has been very successful in establishing working partnerships with foreign Law Enforcement and governments. He sees building "cop-to-cop" connections as the key to fighting global crime. Just as strengthening the coordination between domestic agencies is a necessary step toward a more effective national strategy, improving coordination between American and foreign agencies is also an important part of reducing Global Organized Crime One obstacle would be the reluctance of Intelligence to work even closer with foreign governments, their intelligence agencies and their Law Enforcement. In the case of Russia, many law enforcement officials accept bribes from organized crime and detectives are sometimes forced to not report to their superiors for fear that the suspects will be warned of raids and arrests. Intelligence may not want to work too closely with foreign intelligence agencies in order to protect their sources and methods. However, there is always an intelligence problem of trust when dealing with human sources but the successes of HUMINT demonstrate that the benefits are worth the risks. 6.This study concurs with the HUMINT and Non-proliferation conference studies' recommendation for further use of HUMINT in dealing with transnational threats. These underground networks can be penetrated by human sources. Human agents can learn the complexities and vulnerabilities of an international network of criminal individuals and groups. The expensive satellite imagery that was helpful in collecting information on large military sites during the Cold War may not be that effective in collecting information on Global Organized Crime. There are more risks involved in trusting human sources but it is more effective in dealing with Global Organized Crime and the costs are low when compared with technical collection. Recommendations for the President: 7.This study recommends that the President confer regularly with the Transnational Threats Committee while forming his national strategy on Global Organized Crime. The new Committee offers the President an incredible opportunity to combine all of the separate abilities and interests represented by the DCI, the Attorney General, the Secretaries of State and Defense, under a unified set of anti-global crime objectives. Since IAA97 also states that the President may designate additional members, he has even more opportunities to use the Committee to respond to his needs with regard to transnational threats. The major obstacle is the President's own disapproval of the creation of the Committee. In his statement on signing the Authorization Act regarding the new Committee, he wrote, "Such efforts to dictate the President's policy process unduly intrude upon Executive prerogatives and responsibilities. I would note that under my Executive authority, I have already asked the NSC to examine these issues." The combined decisions of Intelligence and Law Enforcement leaders should provide insights into creating a coordinated policy that the NSC had previously not provided. The President frequently speaks about the importance of addressing transnational threats so he should be more interested in forming an effective solution-oriented policy against them. 8.The President should support the continuation of both the Attorney General and the Secretary of Treasury acting as representatives of Law Enforcement. The President should not select the Attorney General as the single representative for Law Enforcement. The Attorney General already acts as the Law Enforcement spokesperson in many areas dealing with Global Organized Crime. In areas that pertain more to the Treasury, such as financial crimes, the Secretary should continue to be brought in as a representative. MEASURING SUCCESS OF THE REFORMED INTELLIGENCE RESPONSE TO GLOBAL ORGANIZED CRIME
9.The Transnational Threats Committee should make formal annual assessments on the effects of the changes made through the reforms described above and address the weaknesses in the implementation. Reform and improvement of coordination should be a continuous process and the Committee needs to form a systematic way to continue reform of Intelligence and Law Enforcement coordination and the national response to Global Organized Crime. Possible areas for them to examine would be if there was a more cohesive national strategy; if activities overseas were actually being coordinated under the Chief of Station or if Law Enforcement officials were acting independently; and if, as a result of the reforms, there were improvements made in the Global Organized Crime assessments given to policy-makers. The President and his staff should also make a yearly assessment of the success of the Committee. He should provide feedback on how the Committee could better respond to transnational threats and provide him with information relevant to formulating a national strategy. Actual trends in Global Organized Crime and individual cases of major crime groups should be analyzed to determine if the coordinated response formulated by the Committee had an impact on the threat.

ARCPR: CRITICAL REFLECTIONS ON INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZED CRIME, MONEY LAUNDERING, AND CORRUPTION The Canadian Review of Policing Research (2004) ISSN: 1710 6915 CRITICAL REFLECTIONS ON INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZED CRIME, MONEY LAUNDERING, AND CORRUPTION Margaret. E. Beare
Margaret Beare
is an associate professor in the Sociology Department of York University and the Director of the Nathanson Centre for the Study of Organized Crime and Corruption at Osgoode Hall Law School, York University. What follows is a summary of a recently published book entitled Critical Reflections on Transnational Organized Crime, Money Laundering, and Corruption, published in 2003 by the University of Toronto Press, Toronto, Canada. Dr. Beare’s e-mail address is mbeare@yorku.ca. This book features the work of eleven international scholars who were asked to examine the policing and politics that surround transnational crime, organized crime, money laundering and corruption. Most countries are under pressure to respond to such criminal challenges in a uniform manner in accordance with numerous international agreements, conventions, and guidelines; but some critics are concerned about what might be described as a gradual “Americanization” of international policing practices and policies 1
. They are especially concerned about the high priority placed on proceeds of crime and money laundering. This book emphasizes the significance of transnational crimes or organized criminal activity, the impact of illegal proceeds of crime upon specific markets, and the diverse forms of corruption they create. The various articles challenge some of the current political preoccupations with these issues and attempt to compare rhetoric with more empirically-based realities. Themes and Structure of the Book The book explores a number of common themes: the exploitable nature of taking organized crime as problem; the non-empirical basis for much of the media, police, and political responses; and the unintended consequences that can result from well-intentioned enforcement initiatives. Of additional interest are the policing and security industries that have grown up to “combat” organized crime and corruption, and whose livelihoods benefit from the high priority assigned to these forms of criminality. Contributing Authors Chapter One
on “Transnational Organized Crime: The Strange Career of an American Concept” is written by Michael Woodiwiss. 2
He provides us with a historical mapping of the American roots of our current understanding of what has become known as organized crime, and traces not only the antiquity of concern over organized crime but the distortion of our current focus. Power and politics have a determining influence on the definitions of ‘organized crime’ in the present international community. Chapter Two
by Tom Naylor, 3
is entitled “Predators, Parasites, or Free-market Pioneers: Reflections on the Nature and Analysis of Profit-Driven Crime”. It asks the reader to re-examine at a more micro-level the claims that are typically made about profit-driven crimes. He establishes three classifications of profit-driven crimes: predatory crimes for profit, which involve involuntary transfers; market-based exchanges in which illegal goods or services are sold for profit; and commercial exchanges which are the illegal production or illegal distribution of otherwise legal goods or services. Each of these categories of profit-driven crime has a different impact on society, and that impact is not always negative. Hence, societal responses, particularly those of law enforcement agencies, might be wise to differentiate rather than to group together all profit-driven criminal activity under the heading of “organized crime”. Chapter Three,
“From National to Global, from Empirical to Legal: The Ambivalent Concept of Transnational Organized Crime”, is written by Valsimas Mitsilegas. 4
His chapter provides the current European interpretation of legislation in Italy, Germany, the United Kingdom, the European Union and the United Nations. He documents the vague, ill-defined national and organizational responses. His analysis outlines the emergence of the organized-crime offence at the global level, and examines anti-organized crime initiatives against a backdrop of fundamental legal principles, thereby revealing the negotiations and compromises that go into obtaining multi-jurisdictional agreements. Chapter Four, “The Business of Bribery: Globalization, Economic Liberalization, and the ‘Problem’ of Corruption”, is written by James Williams 5
and Margaret Beare, 6
and takes on the issue of transparency. The chapter examines the role of the World Bank, International Monetary Fund and other international organizations such as Transparency International in packaging the current focus on one specific form of corruption, namely that which hinders the economies of the more developed countries. The chapter traces the growing response of international communities to corruption, and argues that globalization has created new political and economic spaces that are being largely filled by initiatives that conform to an economic logic defined by the developed world. International organizations that appear to have separate voices are all reading from the same script: a script that supports global business and finance. Chapter Five
is entitled “Against Transnational Organized Crime, and is written by James Sheptycki. 7
It examines the language that has grown around the activities subsumed under “transnational organized crime”. Sheptycki describes the veil being drawn over police work as policing becomes increasingly international and takes on a new rhetoric of transnational organized crime. The police apparatus now includes security forces and elite squads operating according to diverse international standards. In this new order, traditional accountability mechanisms are no longer adequate. The hard-won advances towards visibility in domestic policing are undermined by the call for all-out war against transnational organized crime. Chapter Six
by Kyle Grayson 8
on “Discourse, Identity, and the US ‘War on Drugs’”, analyses from a Foucaultian perspective the foreign policies of the United States against drug trafficking. He examines the rhetoric of both the “war on drugs” and the “security-threat” that has succeeded in merging drugs with the traditional discourses of transnational crime. His objective in this chapter is to understand both the reasons why the United States has chosen to link drugs with security and the methods by which this linkage has been made. Chapter Seven
on ‘Global Markets and Crime”, is written by Vincenzo Ruggiero. 9
It presents case materials that illustrate the role of ‘legitimate’ professionals in facilitating many ‘transnational’ crimes. He argues that white-collar crime and organized crime are increasingly blurred within the international cross-jurisdictional criminal environment. Vincenzo Ruggiero emphasizes the close links between legitimate business and illegitimate operations and argues that forms of social control help to determine the forms that crime will take. He sees “globalization” changing social control mechanisms, in turn causing changes in criminal activity. One result is an increasingly blurred relationship between the concepts of white-collar crime and organized crime. Cases are presented that illustrate the role of corporations and other ‘legitimate’ segments of society in supporting or facilitating criminal activity. After these somewhat theoretical papers, the remaining four chapters examine more concrete law enforcement issues. In Chapter eight, “Organized Corporate Criminality: Corporate Complicity in Tobacco Smuggling”, Margaret Beare examines in detail one example of a white-collar-organized crime. The tobacco industry has been shown to have operated in identical ways to more traditional notions of organized criminals: actively engaged in smuggling, fraud, money laundering and violence. The revelations concerning the tobacco corporations lead us to question why they have avoided being labelled criminal for so long. While some of their immunity relates to the general difficulty with proving white-collar crime, other equally valid reasons relate to the power of the corporations, and the limited range of people to whom we apply the term “organized criminal” or, for that, matter apply the criminal law. Chapter Nine, “The War on Drugs and the Military: The Case of Colombia”, by Juan Gabriel Ronderos, 10
challenges the rhetoric of the “war” on drugs, and law-enforcement responses arising from the foreign policies that underlie the rhetoric. He examines the consequences of such policies and law enforcement on a country such as Colombia, and shows the unintended consequences of misdirected enforcement strategies or misguided priorities. Chapter Ten
is entitled “Drug Trafficking and Organized Crime in Canada: A Study of High-level Drug Networks” ad is written by Fred Desroches. 11
He demonstrates empirically that the popular rhetoric about so-called “high-level drug traffickers” is largely false. His study 12
is part of a growing body of empirical research suggesting that even high-level drug traffickers come in many different types and that the members of a network engage in many different working arrangements among its members. The key finding is that the majority of traffickers are individual entrepreneurs who could quit, aspire to move up in the illicit occupational chain, or change and work with the competition. His study, based on interviews with high-level drug traffickers in prisons across Canada, dispels some of the myths about these criminals and their relationship to the larger entity collectively termed “organized crime”. If these criminals are not as imagined, perhaps other unverified assumptions about organized criminal groups should be questioned. Chapter Eleven
brings the book to an end with “Follow-the-Money Methods in Crime Control Policy”, a second chapter by Tom Naylor. It was written specifically for the Nathanson Centre for the Study of Organized Crime and Corruption on discusses the inherent fallacies of enforcement strategies directed against money laundering and proceeds of crime. Naylor examines forfeiture laws and the prime international policing strategy of going after illicit money. He challenges the assumptions upon which the prioritizing of anti-money laundering initiatives is based and suggests alternative approaches.

CHINESE TRANSNATIONAL ORGANIZED CRIME: THE FUK CHING
by James O. Finckenauer, Ph.D. International Center National Institute of Justice Organizational Structure
The organizational structure of Chinese organized crime in the United States is quite complex. Broadly defined, there is a great variety of Chinese criminal organizations. These include gangs, secret societies, triads, tongs, Taiwanese organized crime groups, and strictly US-based tongs and gangs. According to Ko-lin Chin, the foremost academic expert in the U.S. on Chinese organized crime, there is no empirical support for the belief that there is a well-organized, monolithic, hierarchical criminal cartel called the ?Chinese Mafia.? Chin says: ?My findings...do not support the notion that a chain of command exists among these various crime groups or that they coordinate with one another routinely in international crimes such as heroin trafficking, money laundering, and the smuggling of aliens? (1996:123). In order to simplify and focus our discussion, this analysis will concentrate on the Fuk Ching gang. The Fuk Ching are active in New York City, and are regarded as one of the most powerful, and also transnationally active, Chinese organized crime groups in the U.S. (Chin, 1996). They are estimated to have approximately 35 members, with another 20 members currently in prison. Other major gangs in New York City include the Ghost Shadows, Flying Dragons, Tung On, and Born-to-Kill. The New York City gangs, like the Fuk Ching, mainly operate extortion and protection rackets in defined neighborhoods in New York?s Chinatown. Their victims are mostly businesses in Chinatown. In California, the Chinese organized crime presence and problem is quite different from that in New York. In California, the dominant groups are the Wo Hop To and the the Wah Ching. One of the structural characteristics that makes Chinese organized crime different from other forms is the relationship between some of the street gangs and certain adult organizations. The latter are called tongs. The Fuk Ching, for example, are affiliated with the Fukien American Association. The Fukien American Association ? as with other tongs and their relationships with gangs ? provide the Fuk Ching with a physical place to gather and hang out. They allow the gang to operate on their (the tong?s) territory, thus legitimizing them with the community. They also provide criminal opportunities (such as protecting gambling operations), as well as supplying money and guns. The Fuk Ching originally emerged in New York in the mid-1980s, and as with other gangs, their main criminal activity in Chinatown was extortion. They were founded by a collection of young men (youth in their late teens and early twenties) from Fujian province in China -- many if not all of whom had criminal records in China. Fuk Ching recruitment today continues to be among Fujianese teenagers. Tong-affiliated gangs, like the Fuk Ching, have an ah kung (grandfather) or shuk foo (uncle) who is their tong leader. The top gang position is the dai dai lo (big big brother). Communicationbetween the tong and the gang occurs principally between these two individuals. Below the dai dai lo in descending order are the dai lo(s) or big brothers, the yee lo/saam lo (clique leaders), and at the bottom the ma jai or little horses. There are a variety of norms and rules that govern the gangs. These include respecting the ah kung, beating up members of other gangs on your turf, not using drugs, following the orders of the dai lo, and not betraying the gang. Rules violators are punished, sometimes severely, such as through physical assault and killing. Violence
Our research and our interviews with various experts confirms that violence is a defining characteristic of Chinese criminal gangs. Use of violence within the group and against other organized crime groups is very prevalent. Disputes over territory and criminal markets among the gangs are typically resolved using kong so, a process of peaceful negotiation. When this does not occur, however, the resolution is usually a violent one, in which guns are used against rival gang members. Law enforcement authorities believe that an escalation of gang violence has taken place in recent years, due in part to the advent of the Fuk Ching, and to gang involvement in alien smuggling activities. Based on his research, Chin concludes the following with respect to Chinese gang violence in general: The capacity for violence appears to be one of the key defining characteristics of street gang culture. Its employment, however, is shaped and determined by a cluster of constraints related to profit-generating goals. Violence between and among gangs is regulated through an agent or ah kung who attempts to channel aggressive behavior in ways that effectively maintain gang coherence. Gang coherence in turn supports the gang?s involvement in extortion activities and in the provision of protection services to organized vice industries in the community (Chin, 1996:138). The Fuk Ching are violent, but their use of violence is not very sophisticated nor specialized. It is not the systematic use of violence (including threats) to protect and gain monopoly control of criminal markets that is associated with mature forms of organized crime. Instead it is more likely to be random street level violence, with guns, employed by anyone in the gang. Sometimes this violence is sanctioned and sometimes not. Economic Resources
Understanding alien smuggling to be the illegal movement of migrants across national borders, and human trafficking to be migrant smuggling that includes coercion and exploitation, the Fuk Ching are extensively involved in both types of activities. Indeed, these criminal activities, along with kidnapping, are the main transnational crimes of the Fuk Ching. Their dominance is related to Fujian Province being the principal source of Chinese being smuggled and trafficked into North America. On the domestic scene, their main criminal activities in New York City?s Chinatown are extortion and gambling. Each Chinese gang dominates these crimes in theirparticular Chinatown neighborhoods. This includes the Fuk Ching. The professionalism and sophistication of the Fuk Ching are quite low, again as compared to more mature forms of organized crime. The same is true of other Chinese criminal gangs operating in the United States. This may be due to their being generally much younger than, for example, LCN or Russian organized crime figures. Also, their criminal activities are not particularly sophisticated, although the Fuk Ching may be becoming more complex in their organizational structure as they become more heavily engaged in human trafficking. In his research, Chin (1996) found that Chinese gangs were quite active in legitimate businesses in New York City?s Chinatown. For example, they owned or operated restaurants, retail stores, vegetable stands, car services, ice cream parlors, fish markets, and video stores. On a higher, more professional level, they also owned or operated wholesale supply firms, factories, banks, and employment agencies. In addition, on the West Coast Chinese gangs are believed to have penetrated the entertainment industry. Perhaps it is because of their relatively small size, the youth of their members, their lack of business experience and acumen, and the geographical constraints in which they operate, that Chinese gangs such as the Fuk Ching do not seem to play significant roles in the broader legitimate economy. Political Resources
The expert consensus is that the Fuk Ching, like other Chinese gangs, do not have the connections and stature to make them capable of corrupting U.S. police and judges. There have been only one or two cases of police corruption (none in recent years), and no cases of judicial corruption. As to political influence, there is some ability to manipulate the political system via corruption in China ? namely in Fujian Province and with respect to their human trafficking enterprise. In the United States, however, there is no evidence of corrupting the political process, of getting members elected or appointed to political office, nor of being able to manage media coverage of their activities. They are influential only in Chinatown, and their connections to U.S. politicians are non-existent. Any political influence Chinese gangs have is exerted through the tongs with which they are affiliated. For example, it is reported that the head of the Fukien American Association once gave $6,500 to a New York City Mayor?s re-election campaign (Kleinknecht, 1996:168). That the affiliation is not only beneficial to the gangs is evidenced in Chin?s report that tongs and other Chinatown community organizations benefit from the Chinese gangs? threats of extortion because business owners donate money to the associations in the belief that this will buy protection (1996). There is no evidence that Chinese gangs are involved with political terrorism either abroad or at home. Nor that they are associated with armed political groups of any kind. Response of Law Enforcement
The New York City Police Department (NYPD), which polices the neighborhood in which the Fuk Ching are active, uses all the standard law enforcement practices commonly used to combat organized crime. These include informants, undercover investigators, and electronic surveillance. In addition, both the police and the FBI support and encourage extortion victims to use hot lines to report their victimization. The NYPD has also created an Asian Gang Intelligence Unit that employs street patrols to monitor street gangs. Of the 15 Chinese crime groups indicted under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) between 1985 and 1994, one involved the Fuk Ching. In that 1993 case, 20 defendants were charged with, and pled guilty to murder. The investigation was conducted jointly by the FBI and the NYPD. On the international level, U.S. law enforcement has undertaken a number of initiatives to improve international cooperation against Chinese organized crime groups. These include the creation of the International Law Enforcement Academy (ILEA) in Bangkok, Thailand, and sponsorship of numerous international meetings on Asian organized crime. Annual meetings of the International Asian Organized Crime Conference attract more than a thousand law enforcement officials from dozens of countries. Both the ILEA and the conferences promote interaction among officials of affected countries, and lead to better cooperation and better information. Ko-lin Chin concludes that many crimes in Chinese-American communities ? especially drug trafficking, money laundering, and human trafficking ? are linked to China. He says that Chinese gang members flee to China when sought by American law enforcement. He recommends that ?deportation, extradition, joint operations, and intelligence sharing among law enforcement authorities from various countries...be carried out routinely....extradition treaties...be instated....[and that] U.S. authorities...be more culturally sensitive in dealing with foreign law enforcement agencies? (Chin, 1996:187). The External Environment
There is not general cultural acceptance of Chinese gangs such as the Fuk Ching in Chinatown. Most Chinese business owners comply with gang extortion demands because compliance is easier and less risky than resistance. As previously indicated, the gang affiliation with a tong gives them a degree of acceptability in the neighborhoods associated with that particular tong. The gang must be tolerated in order to gain any benefit that accrues from the tong. It would seem that there is little need in Chinatown for awareness raising campaigns on organized crime, or for sensitizing citizens on the dangers and threats posed by Chinese gangs. The Chinese who live in these neighborhoods are fully aware and fully sensitized. Rather than public information campaigns, Chinese businessmen would prefer a tougher criminal justice system. As Chin reports, ?they [Chinese businessmen] would like to see harsher punishment for offenders, the reinstitution of the death penalty..., and the deportation of chronic Chinese criminals? (1996:98). They also want to see many more Chinese police officers in theirneighborhoods. Because of the compartmentalized nature of Chinese organized crime in the United States, the public at large is little aware of and little concerned about what is going on in Chinatowns in U.S. cities. National media pay relatively little attention to these problems. For example, an Internet search of major U.S. newspapers under the topic ?Asian organized crime? for the period January 1, 1998 - August 1, 2000 produced only 13 articles. Chinese involvement in human smuggling, however, may be the exception to this rule. Chinese human smuggling has received considerable attention. A recent conference in Washington, DC on human smuggling pointed to five possible reasons for the high public profile given Chinese smuggling operations: (1) they are expensive; (2) associated human rights abuses are considerable; (3) they are highly efficient; (4) there is an enormous potential pool of migrants; and (5) collecting intelligence and other information from China is extraordinarily difficult (Conference Report, Transatlantic Workshop on Human Smuggling, 2000). Human trafficking activities by Chinese gangs such as the Fuk Ching are contributing to this higher profile. REFERENCES

WASHINGTON (AFP) Tuesday April 26, 2005
The
Hubble
Space
Telescope
turned 15,
with
750,000 photographs of deep space
and Earth to its credit, but its future is now uncertain. Hubble
was launched by the
Space
Shuttle Discovery on April 25, 1990, and opened a new era in astronomy. However, the
telescope, a cooperative effort of NASA and the
European Space
Agency, would not be operational until three years later. [The Hubble Space Telescope]

Enlarge The Hubble Space Telescope
A mirror that had been improperly ground was corrected in 1993, when a new camera was also installed in the
first repair mission by a space
shuttle. Once repaired, the
telescope
beamed back photographs 10 times sharper than ever before of galaxies, supernovas, giant explosions marking the
death of a star and the
birth of a black hole. Thanks to Hubble, flying above the
atmospheric distortion that hinders even more powerful Earth-based telescopes, scientists have been able to confirm that the
universe is rapidly expanding and to calculate precisely its age, at 13.7 billion years, according to NASA. Among other achievements, Hubble's observations allowed scientists to confirm the
existence of a strange form of energy called dark energy; proved the
existence of super-massive black holes; provided sharp views of a comet hitting Jupiter; and showed that the
process of forming planetary systems is common throughout the
galaxy, NASA said in a statement. NASA has so far decided not to send a shuttle to repair the
aging Hubble, citing the
450 million dollars it would cost to do so. But the
space
agency's new chief, Michael Griffin, has said he would revisit the
decision. Astronauts have serviced Hubble
four times, and many scientists hoped that a fifth service mission would be funded to enable Hubble
to function to 2011, when its infrared replacement, the
James Webb Space
Telescope, is scheduled to arrive. Currently, it is believed that Hubble's aging solar cells will provide enough energy to survive to 2007.   Hubble Space Telescope turns 15, with a galaxy of achievements

White House Cuts Hubble Servicing Mission from 2006 Budget Request Astronomers Surprised by White House Plan to Scuttle Hubble The Fight Begins Once Again for Hubble's Life By Leonard David
Senior Space Writer posted: 24 January 2005 06:44 am ET
space
A White House decision to cut funding for a Hubble Space Telescope servicing mission and dump the observatory into a remote stretch of ocean waters at a future date is sure to incite debate in scientific, engineering, and policy making circles. Intensive work has been underway at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center to develop telerobotic servicing skills for the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) in the event that a space shuttle crew is never again sent to the orbiting facility. Aerospace firms in the United States and in Canada have teamed with NASA to develop a Hubble Robotic Vehicle Deorbit Module. Either a robotic or shuttle-based servicing option reportedly would cost in excess of $1 billion. That pricetag is viewed by the White House, according to sources, as not affordable given other high-priority and more expensive efforts, such as the return-to-flight of the space shuttle program, as well as moving forward on NASA’s Moon, Mars and beyond agenda. White House plans to scuttle Hubble is part of NASA’s 2006 budget request, sources said, with some money in the budget allocated to using a propulsion module coupled to Hubble for its safe but destructive deorbiting. The cutting of the HST servicing mission from NASA’s 2006 budget request was first reported
by Space News
on its website Friday and on  SPACE.com
. Leading the fight Senator Barbara Mikulski (D-Md.), a fervent Hubble supporter whose state is home to both the Goddard Space Flight Center and the Space Telescope Science Institute, issued a statement late January 21 in which she vowed to continue advocating an HST servicing mission. "It is essential that we have a safe and reliable servicing mission to Hubble," Mikulski said, that is consistent with the findings of the Columbia Accident Investigation Board and last month’s findings of a National Academy of Sciences (NAS) panel on the Hubble issue. On December 8, in the NAS final report released by the Committee on the Assessment of Options for Extending the Life of the Hubble Space Telescope, a blue ribbon group of experts said that NASA should reinstate a space shuttle mission to refurbish the Earth-orbiting telescope. "I led the fight to add $300 million to NASA’s budget last year for a Hubble servicing mission, and I plan to lead the fight again this year. This is what the American people expect and deserve," Mikulski said in a statement.  In defense of Hubble Response to the White House decision has engendered a wait-and-see attitude in some astronomical quarters, while others have been quick to react. Hubble’s best days lie ahead, predicted John Bahcall, a professor of natural sciences at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey. In 1998, he was a recipient of the National Medal of Science for his pioneering efforts in neutrino astrophysics and his contributions to the development and planning of the Hubble Space Telescope. "President Nixon cancelled in 1973 the Hubble Telescope while it was still in the development phase. The reason was similar: other activities in the NASA budget took priority," Bahcall told SPACE.com. "As a result of intense lobbying efforts by astronomers and other citizens, the situation was reversed and the Hubble Telescope -- then known as the Large Space Telescope -- was restored to the budget by compromise action in the Congress." Bahcall said that Hubble has contributed enormously to scientific knowledge and to America’s respect abroad. The telescope represents achievements of which all Americans can be proud, he said. "I am confident that Americans of all walks of life will come to the defense of the Hubble and cause the Congress to restore the repair of the telescope to the NASA budget," Bahcall said. Telerobotic progress Excellent progress is being made on a telerobotic approach to servicing the Hubble, said Jim Crocker, vice president of civil space at Lockheed Martin Space Systems of Denver. The firm has supported NASA’s planning and then repair and servicing of the HST via four space shuttle missions to date. The telerobotics team at work at Goddard Space Flight Center "have a good shot at pulling this off," Crocker told SPACE.com
the day before the Space News
story on the White House HST decision appeared. Lockheed Martin’s role in the rocket-launched Hubble Robotic Vehicle Deorbit Module (HRVDM), Crocker said, is providing all the sensors to do the rendezvous and docking with the Hubble, as well as provide the liquid-fueled propellant module that would later deorbit the telescope. For their part, Canada’s MacDonald, Dettwiler and Associates (MDA) Ltd. -- through its MD Robotics group in Brampton, Ontario -- is providing the Dextre robot that’s part of the HRVDM. It is being specially configured to replace batteries, gyroscopes, and perhaps an instrument on the HST to extend its life. NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center is overseeing and integrating the HRVDM work. Crocker said that simulations performed at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight center have converted doubters, including him, that performing many of the scheduled Hubble servicing tasks through the tender loving care of telerobotics is feasible. "That’s not to say it’s not challenging," Crocker said, "but the team is making a convincing story." Rabbit out of the hat There’s also good news to report in keeping Hubble in an operating mode. Worry centers on HST’s gyroscopes, batteries, or other gear that might fail early, negating the observatory’s useful lifetime. "The team continues to pull rabbits out of the hat," Crocker said. For instance, a two gyro science mode, along with the needed software has been worked out. HST’s original design had to have three gyros working to do science. Additionally, a new battery management approach is being adopted. "That’s good news," Crocker said. "I’m hearing we’re likely to be able to get [HST] into 2008 now." At the end of the day, Crocker concluded, whatever option is decided upon for Hubble servicing and its ultimate reentry, "everyone on the team wants the best chance of success possible."    Sponsored Links

TREC-8 Interactive Track Guidelines
TREC-8 Interactive Track Guidelines Goal  ----  The high-level goal of the Interactive Track in TREC-8 remains the investigation of searching as an interactive task by examining the process as well as the outcome. To this end a experimental framework has been designed with the following common features:         - an interactive search task         - 6 topics         - a document collection to be searched         - a required set of searcher (demographics) questionnaires         - 6 classes of data to be collected at each site and submitted to NIST         - 3 summary measures to be calculated by NIST for use by participants The framework will allow groups to estimate the effect of their experimental manipulation free and clear of the main (additive) effects of participant and topic and it will reduce the effect of interactions. In TREC-8 the emphasis will be on each group's exploration of different approaches to supporting the common searcher task and understanding the reasons for the results they get. No formal coordination of hypotheses or comparison of systems across sites is planned for TREC-8, but groups are encouraged to seek out and exploit synergies. As a first step, groups are strongly encouraged to make the focus of their planned investigations known to other track participants as soon as possible, preferably via the track listserv at trec-int@ohsu.edu.  Contact track chair Bill Hersh
to join. General Description  -------------------  A minimum of 12 participating searchers, one experimental system, and one control system per site will be required.  The control system can be any IR system appropriate to the goals of the local experiment, e.g. a variant of the local experimental system, some other baseline system such as SMART, ZPRISE, etc.  (See "2. Augmentation" in the detailed experimental design for information about how to use more than eight searchers or more than one experimental system within this design.) Each searcher will perform six searches on the Financial Times of London 1991-1994 collection (part of the TREC-8 adhoc collection), using six topics especially chosen from the TREC-8 adhoc topics and modified for use in the interactive track.  Each searcher will perform half of the total number of searches on the site's experimental system and the other half on its control system.  The experimental design (see below) determines the order in which each searcher performs the query and uses the systems (experimental and control). In resolving experimental design questions not covered here (e.g., scheduling of tutorials and searches, etc.), participating sites should try to minimize the differences between the conditions under which a given searcher uses the control and those under which s/he uses the experimental system. For example, running all the control searches for a participant on one day and the searches on the experimental system on another invites unequal, confounding conditions. Topics ------ Each of the topics will describe a need for information of a particular type. Contained within the documents of the collection to be searched will be multiple distinct examples or instances of the needed information. The interactive topics will be modified versions of specially selected adhoc topics. Here is an example TREC-6 adhoc topic:         Number: 303          Title: Hubble Telescope Achievements          Description:          Identify positive accomplishments of the Hubble telescope          since it was launched in 1991.         Narrative:          Documents are relevant that show the Hubble telescope has          produced new data, better quality data than previously          available, data that has increased human knowledge of the          universe, or data that has led to disproving previously          existing theories or hypotheses.  Documents limited to the          shortcomings of the telescope would be irrelevant.  Details          of repairs or modifications to the telescope without          reference to positive achievements would not be relevant. Here is an example of the same topic as it would be modified for use in the TREC-8 interactive track. Note the addition of the "Please save" paragraph and the removal of the usual Narrative section with its specific criteria for relevance or non-relevance:         Number: 303i          Title: Hubble Telescope Achievements          Description:          Identify positive accomplishments of the Hubble telescope          since it was launched in 1991.         Instances:         In the time alloted, please find as many DIFFERENT positive          accomplishments of the sort described above as you can.         Please save at least one document for EACH such DIFFERENT          accomplishment.         If one document discusses several such accomplishments, then          you need not save other documents that repeat those, since your          goal is to identify as many DIFFERENT accomplishments of the sort          described above as possible.

Instances: In the time alloted, please find as many DIFFERENT countries of the sort described above as you can. Please save at least one document for EACH such DIFFERENT country. If one document discusses several such countries, then you need not save other documents that repeat those, since your goal is to identify as many DIFFERENT countries of the sort described above as possible. Searcher task ------------- The task of the interactive searcher is to save documents, which, taken together, contain as many different instances as possible of  the type of information the topic expresses a need for - within a 20 minute time limit. Searchers will be encouraged to avoid saving documents which contribute no instances beyond those in documents already saved, but there will be no scoring penalty for saving such documents and searchers will be told that. Instructions to be given to searchers ------------------------------------- The following introductory instructions are to be given once to each searcher before the first search:         "Imagine that you have just returned from a visit to your doctor          during which it was discovered that you are suffering from high         blood pressure. The doctor suggests that you take a new experimental         drug, but you wonder what alternative treatments are currently          available.  You decide to investigate the literature on your own         to satisfy your need for information about what different          alternatives are available to you for high blood pressure treatment.         You really need only one document for each of the different          treatments for high blood pressure.          You find and save a single document that lists four treatment drugs.         Then you find and save another two documents that each discusses a         separate alternative treatment: one that discusses the use of         calcium and one that talks about regular exercise.  You've run out          of time and stop your search. In all, you have identified six          different instances of alternative treatments in three documents.          ---         In this experiment, you will face a similar task. You will be          presented with several descriptions of needed information on a          number of topics. In each case there can be multiple examples or          instances of the type of information that's needed.         We would like you to identify as many different instances as you         can of the needed information for each topic that will be presented          to you -  as many as you can in the 20 minutes you will be given          to search.  Please save one document for EACH DIFFERENT instance          of the needed information that you identify. If you save one          document that contains several instances, try not to save additional         documents that contain ONLY those instances. However, you will not          be penalized if you save documents unnecessarily.           As you identify an instance of the needed information, please keep          track of which instances you have found: write down a word or short          phrase to identify the instance, or--if the system provides a          facility to keep track of instances--use it.                  Carefully read each topic to understand the type of information          needed. This will vary from topic to topic. On one topic you may be          looking for instances of a certain kind of event. On another you may          be searching for examples of certain sorts of people, places, or          things.         Do you have any questions about          - what we mean by instances of needed information          - the way in which you are to save nonredundant documents for each           instance?" Searcher questionnaires (minimum) ----------------------- Provided by Rutgers (see track web site) Data to be collected and submitted to NIST (emailed to over@nist.gov) ------------------------------------------ Several sorts of result data will be collected for evaluation/analysis (for all searches unless otherwise specified):    ===>  Due at NIST by 30. August 1999:         1. sparse format data       ===>  Due at NIST by when the site reports for the conference are due:         2. rich format data         3. a full narrative description of one interactive session for            whichever topic is designated as T1         4. any further guidance or refinement of the task specification            given to the searchers         5. data from the common searcher questionnaires Sparse format data for each search will comprise the list of documents saved and the elapsed clock time of the search. The searcher's selection (choice) of items for the final output list must be identified in terms of each document's TREC document identifier (DOCNO). The elapsed (clock) time in seconds taken for the search, from the time the searcher first sees the topic until s/he declares the search to be finished, should be recorded.  It is assumed that the interactive search takes place in one uninterrupted session.  If a session is unavoidably interrupted, it is recommended that it be abandoned and the topic given to another searcher.  Sparse format data will be the basis for the summary evaluation at NIST, which will produce a triple for each search: instance precision, instance recall, and elapsed clock time. Rich format data for each search will record: - the word or phrase each searcher records to describe each   instance s/he identifies (no reference to the containing document(s)) - significant events in the course of the interaction and their    timing.             Rich format data are intended for analytical evaluation by the            experimenters.             All significant events and their timing in the course of the            interaction should be recorded.  The events listed below are those            that seem to be fairly generally applicable to different systems            and interactive environments; however, the list may need extending            or modifying for specific systems and so should be taken as a            suggestion rather than a requirement:           o Intermediate search formulations:  if appropriate to the              system, these should be recorded.           o Documents viewed:  "viewing" is taken to mean the searcher              seeing a title or some other brief information about a              document; these events should be recorded.           o Documents seen:  "seeing" is taken to mean the searcher              seeing the text of a document, or a substantial section of              text; these events should be recorded.            o Terms entered by the searcher:  if appropriate to the              system, these should be recorded.           o Terms seen (offered by the system):  if appropriate to the              system, these should be recorded.           o Selection/rejection:  documents or terms selected by the              user for any further stage of the search (in addition to the              final selection of documents).  Format of sparse data to be submitted to NIST --------------------------------------------- TWO files from each site            A. Search file         Here a "search" is the interaction of a searcher given a topic         and asked to carry out the interactive search task using a given          system against the collection - lasting at most 20 minutes.         One line for EACH SEARCH, each line containing the          following blank-delimited items from left to right:                 1. Unique site ID                 2. Search ID  - site's choice (links search & document files)                 3. Searcher ID - site's choice                 4. System ID - site's choice                 5. TREC topic number                                          6. Elapsed time - number of secs., fractions truncated                    Clock time from the moment the searcher sees the                     topic until the moment the searcher indicates the                     search is complete or time is up.   B. Documents file         One line for each document in a given search result,         each line containing the following blank-delimited         items from left to right:                 1. Chronological sequence number ( "1", "2") within a search                    Use number of last time saved if saved multiple times.                          2. Search ID (from search file)                 3. TREC document identifier (DOCNO)              NOTE: Reported data items listed within each line must NOT          contain whitespace.      Format of other data to be submitted to NIST -------------------------------------------- Data other than that in sparse-format should be submitted as ASCII text files. The FA-1 score plus the questionaire data for each searcher should be  submitted in a separate file with format close to the following example but with the real responses to the right of the colons. The Tutorial Worksheet and Experimenter Note need not be submitted.         S i t e:         S e a r c h e r  I D:         FA-1 score:  ?         P r e - s e a r c h :                   (1 per searcher)         Searcher:       id         Condition:      ?         Degrees:        degree major date         Degrees:        degree major date         Degrees:        degree major date         Degrees:        degree major date         Degrees:        degree major date         Occupation:     ...         Gender:         M | F         Age:            nn         Previous TREC:  Y | N         Online searching: nn         Q1:             1-5         Q2:             1-5         Q3:             1-5         Q4:             1-5         Q5:             1-5         Q6:             1-5         Q7:             1-5         Q8:             1-5         S e a r c h :                           (8 per searcher)         Searcher:       id         Condition:      ?         Topic #:        nnn         Q1:             1-5         Q2:             1-5         Q3:             1-5         Q4:             1-5         Q5:             1-5         Q6:             1-5         P o s t - s y s t e m :                 (2 per searcher)         Searcher:       id         Condition:      ?         Q1:             1-5         Q2:             1-5         Q3:             1-5         Comments:       ...         S e a r c h e r   w o r k s h e e t :   (8 per searcher)         Searcher:       id         Condition:      ?         Topic #:        nnn         1.              ...         2.              ...         3.              ...         .         .         .                  E x i t :                               (1 per searcher)         Searcher        id         Q1:             1-5         Q2:             1-5         Q3:             1-5         Q4:             one-system's-name       rank                         other-system's-name     rank         Q5:             one-system's-name       rank                         other-system's-name     rank         Q6:             one-system's-name       rank                         other-system's-name     rank         Q7:             ...         Q8:             ...         Q9:             ... Evaluation of data submitted to NIST ------------------------------------ Evaluation by NIST of the sparse format data will proceed as follows. For each topic, a pool will be formed containing the unique documents saved by at least one searcher for that topic regardless of site. For each topic, the NIST assessor, normally the topic author, will be asked  to:         - read the topic carefully          - read each of the documents from the pool for that topic and            gradually:            - create a list of instances of the topic's needed information              type found somewhere in the documents            - select and record a short phrase describing each instance found            - determine which documents contain which instances            - bracket each instance in the text of the document in which it               was found For each search (by a given participant for a given topic at a given site),  NIST will use the submitted list of selected documents and the assessor's instance-document mapping for the topic to calculate:         - the fraction of total instances (as determined by the assessor) for            the topic that are covered by the submitted documents (i.e.,            instance recall)         - the fraction of the submitted documents which contain one or more           instances (i.e., instance precision)   The third measure, elapsed clock time, will be taken directly from the  submitted results for each search. Experimental design for a site ------------------------------   1. Minimal experimental matrix as run     The design for this year's track departs from last year's.  One limitation     of last year's balanced block design was the potential statistical     confouding of topic and its order.  A design that controls for query order     leads to a simpler statistical analysis of results.     As such, this year's approach will insure that each query is searched in     each position (first through sixth) by each system.  This requires a     minimum of 12 searchers per site.  In addition, the query orders for     each site will need to be generated in a pseudorandom fashion.  To make     this process consistent, the query orders will be generated by the OHSU     group.  Below is an example of system-query order for a site.  (NOTE:     Please do not use this example, as new sets must be generated for each     12-searcher block.)                  Subject       Block #1           Block #2                      1      System 1: 6-1-2    System 2: 3-4-5                      2      System 2: 1-2-3    System 1: 4-5-6                      3      System 2: 2-3-4    System 1: 5-6-1                      4      System 2: 3-4-5    System 1: 6-1-2                      5      System 1: 4-5-6    System 2: 1-2-3                      6      System 1: 5-6-1    System 2: 2-3-4                      7      System 2: 6-1-2    System 1: 3-4-5                      8      System 1: 1-2-3    System 2: 4-5-6                      9      System 1: 2-3-4    System 2: 5-6-1                     10      System 1: 3-4-5    System 2: 6-1-2                     11      System 2: 4-5-6    System 1: 1-2-3                     12      System 2: 5-6-1    System 1: 2-3-4     Query blocks should be requested from Bill Hersh
as early as possible.   2. Augmentation      The design for a given site can be augmented in two ways:        1. Participants can be added in groups of 6 using the design           above.  Additional blocks should be requested from Bill           Hersh.        2. Systems can be added by adding additional groups of 6 users           with each new system.  Additional blocks should be requested           Bill Hersh.      Topics cannot be added/subtracted individually for each site.       All augmentations other than the two listed above, however interesting,       are outside the scope of this design. If sites plan such adjunct       experiments, they are encouraged to design them for maximal synergy       with the track design.  3. Analysis      Up to each group, but all are strongly encouraged to take advantage      of the experimental design and undertake:         1. exploratory data analysis            to examine the patterns of correlation, interaction, etc.            involving the major factors. Some example plots for the TREC-6            interactive data (recall or precision by searcher or topic)            are available on the Interactive Track web site            <> under "Interactive Track History".                     2. analysis of variance (ANOVA), where appropriate,            to estimate the separate contributions of searcher, topic and             system as a first step in understanding why the results of one             search are different from those of another Last updated: Wednesday, 20-Aug-03 07:33:34 Date created: Monday, 31-Jul-00 For information about this webpage contact Paul Over

TREC-7 Interactive Track Guidelines
TREC-7 Interactive Track Guidelines Goal ---- The high-level goal of the Interactive Track in TREC-7 remains the investigation of searching as an interactive task by examining the process as well as the outcome. To this end a experimental framework has been designed with the following common features: - an interactive search task - 8 topics - a document collection to be searched - a required set of searcher (demographics) questionnaires - a required psychometric test for all searchers - 6 classes of data to be collected at each site and submitted to NIST - 3 summary measures to be calculated by NIST for use by participants The framework will allow groups to estimate the effect of their experimental manipulation free and clear of the main (additive) effects of participant and topic and it will reduce the effect of interactions. In TREC-7 the emphasis will be on each group's exploration of different approaches to supporting the common searcher task and understanding the reasons for the results they get. No formal coordination of hypotheses or comparison of systems across sites is planned for TREC-7, but groups are encouraged to seek out and exploit synergies. As a first step, groups are strongly encouraged to make the focus of their planned investigations known to other track participants as soon as possible. General Description ------------------- A minimum of eight participating searchers, one experimental system, and one control system per site will be required. The control system can be any IR system appropriate to the goals of the local experiment, e.g. a variant of the local experimental system, some other baseline system such as SMART, ZPRISE, etc. (See "2. Augmentation" in the detailed experimental design for information about how to use more than eight searchers or more than one experimental system within this design.) Each searcher will perform eight searches on the Financial Times of London 1991-1994 collection (part of the TREC-7 adhoc collection), using eight topics especially chosen from the TREC-7 adhoc topics and modified for use in the interactive track. Each searcher will perform half of the total number of searches on the site's experimental system and the other half on its control system. The detailed experimental design (see below) determines the order in which each searcher uses the systems (experimental and control). In resolving experimental design questions not covered here (e.g., scheduling of tutorials and searches, etc.), participating sites should try to minimize the differences between the conditions under which a given searcher uses the control and those under which s/he uses the experimental system. For example, running all the control searches for a participant on one day and the searches on the experimental system on another invites unequal, confounding conditions. Topics ------ Each of the topics will describe a need for information of a particular type. Contained within the documents of the collection to be searched will be multiple distinct examples or instances of the needed information. The interactive topics will be modified versions of specially selected adhoc topics. Here is an example TREC-6 adhoc topic: Number: 303i Title: Hubble Telescope Achievements Description: Identify positive accomplishments of the Hubble telescope since it was launched in 1991. Narrative: Documents are relevant that show the Hubble telescope has produced new data, better quality data than previously available, data that has increased human knowledge of the universe, or data that has led to disproving previously existing theories or hypotheses. Documents limited to the shortcomings of the telescope would be irrelevant. Details of repairs or modifications to the telescope without reference to positive achievements would not be relevant. Here is an example of the same topic as it would be modified for use in the TREC-7 interactive track. Note the addition of the "Please save" paragraph and the removal of the usual Narrative section with its specific criteria for relevance or non-relevance: Number: 303i Title: Hubble Telescope Achievements Description: Identify positive accomplishments of the Hubble telescope since it was launched in 1991. Instances: In the time alloted, please find as many DIFFERENT positive accomplishments of the sort described above as you can. Please save at least one document for EACH such DIFFERENT accomplishment. If one document discusses several such accomplishments, then you need not save other documents that repeat those, since your goal is to identify as many DIFFERENT accomplishments of the sort described above as possible. Here are the topics for TREC-7 in NUMERICAL order. See the section "Experimental design for a site" below for their assignment to blocks and the order of presentation within the experimental design. ------------------------------------------------------------------------- Number: 352i Title: British Chunnel impacts Description: Impacts of the Chunnel - anticipated or actual - on the British economy and/or the life style of the British Instances: In the time alloted, please find as many DIFFERENT impacts of the sort described above as you can. Please save at least one document for EACH such DIFFERENT impact. If one document discusses several such impacts, then you need not save other documents that repeat those, since your goal is to identify as many DIFFERENT impacts of the sort described above as possible. ------------------------------------------------------------------------- Number: 353i Title: Antarctic exploration Description: Identify systematic explorations and scientific investigations of Antarctica, current or planned. Instances: In the time alloted, please find as many DIFFERENT explorations or investigations of the sort described above as you can. Please save at least one document for EACH such DIFFERENT exploration or investigation. If one document discusses several such investigations/explorations, then you need not save other documents that repeat those, since your goal is to identify as many DIFFERENT investigations or explorations of the sort described above as possible. ------------------------------------------------------------------------- Number: 357i Title: territorial waters dispute Description: Identify documents discussing international boundary disputes relevant to the 200-mile special economic zones or 12-mile territorial waters subsequent to the passing of the "International Convention on the Law of the Sea". Instances: In the time alloted, please find as many DIFFERENT disputes of the sort described above as you can. Please save at least one document for EACH such DIFFERENT dispute. If one document discusses several such disputes, then you need not save other documents that repeat those, since your goal is to identify as many DIFFERENT disputes of the sort described above as possible. ------------------------------------------------------------------------- Number: 362i Title: human smuggling Description: Identify incidents of human smuggling. Instances: In the time alloted, please find as many DIFFERENT incidents of the sort described above as you can. Please save at least one document for EACH DIFFERENT incident of the sort described above.

Instances: In the time alloted, please find as many DIFFERENT applications of the sort described above as you can. Please save at least one document for EACH such DIFFERENT application. If one document discusses several such applications, then you need not save other documents that repeat those, since your goal is to identify as many DIFFERENT applications of the sort described above as possible. ------------------------------------------------------------------------- Searcher task ------------- The task of the interactive searcher is to save documents, which, taken together, contain as many different instances as possible of the type of information the topic expresses a need for - within a 15 minute time limit. Searchers will be encouraged to avoid saving documents which contribute no instances beyond those in documents already saved, but there will be no scoring penalty for saving such documents and searchers will be told that. Instructions to be given to searchers ------------------------------------- The following introductory instructions are to be given once to each searcher before the first search: "Imagine that you have just returned from a visit to your doctor during which it was discovered that you are suffering from high blood pressure. The doctor suggests that you take a new experimental drug, but you wonder what alternative treatments are currently available. You decide to investigate the literature on your own to satisfy your need for information about what different alternatives are available to you for high blood pressure treatment. You really need only one document for each of the different treatments for high blood pressure. You find and save a single document that lists four treatment drugs. Then you find and save another two documents that each discusses a separate alternative treatment: one that discusses the use of calcium and one that talks about regular exercise. You've run out of time and stop your search. In all, you have identified six different instances of alternative treatments in three documents. --- In this experiment, you will face a similar task. You will be presented with several descriptions of needed information on a number of topics. In each case there can be multiple examples or instances of the type of information that's needed. We would like you to identify as many different instances as you can of the needed information for each topic that will be presented to you - as many as you can in the 15 minutes you will be given to search. Please save one document for EACH DIFFERENT instance of the needed information that you identify. If you save one document that contains several instances, try not to save additional documents that contain ONLY those instances. However, you will not be penalized if you save documents unnecessarily. As you identify an instance of the needed information, please keep track of which instances you have found: write down a word or short phrase to identify the instance, or--if the system provides a facility to keep track of instances--use it. Carefully read each topic to understand the type of information needed. This will vary from topic to topic. On one topic you may be looking for instances of a certain kind of event. On another you may be searching for examples of certain sorts of people, places, or things.

October 1998: 2. rich format data 3. a full narrative description of one interactive session for whichever topic is designated as T1 4. any further guidance or refinement of the task specification given to the searchers 5. data from the common searcher questionnaires 6. results from the psychometric test (FA-1) given to all searchers Sparse format data for each search will comprise the list of documents saved and the elapsed clock time of the search. The searcher's selection (choice) of items for the final output list must be identified in terms of each document's TREC document identifier (DOCNO). The elapsed (clock) time in seconds taken for the search, from the time the searcher first sees the topic until s/he declares the search to be finished, should be recorded. It is assumed that the interactive search takes place in one uninterrupted session. If a session is unavoidably interrupted, it is recommended that it be abandoned and the topic given to another searcher. Sparse format data will be the basis for the summary evaluation at NIST, which will produce a triple for each search: instance precision, instance recall, and elapsed clock time. Rich format data for each search will record: - the word or phrase each searcher records to describe each instance s/he identifies (no reference to the containing document(s)) - significant events in the course of the interaction and their timing. Rich format data are intended for analytical evaluation by the experimenters. All significant events and their timing in the course of the interaction should be recorded. The events listed below are those that seem to be fairly generally applicable to different systems and interactive environments; however, the list may need extending or modifying for specific systems and so should be taken as a suggestion rather than a requirement: o Intermediate search formulations: if appropriate to the system, these should be recorded. o Documents viewed: "viewing" is taken to mean the searcher seeing a title or some other brief information about a document; these events should be recorded. o Documents seen: "seeing" is taken to mean the searcher seeing the text of a document, or a substantial section of text; these events should be recorded. o Terms entered by the searcher: if appropriate to the system, these should be recorded. o Terms seen (offered by the system): if appropriate to the system, these should be recorded. o Selection/rejection: documents or terms selected by the user for any further stage of the search (in addition to the final selection of documents). Format of sparse data to be submitted to NIST --------------------------------------------- TWO files from each site A. Search file Here a "search" is the interaction of a searcher given a topic and asked to carry out the interactive search task using a given system against the collection - lasting at most 20 minutes. One line for EACH SEARCH, each line containing the following blank-delimited items from left to right: 1. Unique site ID 2. Search ID - site's choice (links search & document files) 3. Searcher ID - site's choice 4. System ID - site's choice 5. TREC topic number 6. Elapsed time - number of secs., fractions truncated Clock time from the moment the searcher sees the topic until the moment the searcher indicates the search is complete or time is up. B. Documents file One line for each document in a given search result, each line containing the following blank-delimited items from left to right: 1. Chronological sequence number ( "1", "2") within a search Use number of last time saved if saved multiple times. 2. Search ID (from search file) 3. TREC document identifier (DOCNO) NOTE: Reported data items listed within each line must NOT contain whitespace. Format of other data to be submitted to NIST -------------------------------------------- Data other than that in sparse-format should be submitted as ASCII text files. The FA-1 score plus the questionaire data for each searcher should be submitted in a separate file with format close to the following example but with the real responses to the right of the colons. The Tutorial Worksheet and Experimenter Note need not be submitted. S i t e: S e a r c h e r I D: FA-1 score: ? P r e - s e a r c h : (1 per searcher) Searcher: id Condition: ?

Q8: ... Q9: ... Evaluation of data submitted to NIST ------------------------------------ Evaluation by NIST of the sparse format data will proceed as follows. For each topic, a pool will be formed containing the unique documents saved by at least one searcher for that topic regardless of site. For each topic, the NIST assessor, normally the topic author, will be asked to: - read the topic carefully - read each of the documents from the pool for that topic and gradually: - create a list of instances of the topic's needed information type found somewhere in the documents - select and record a short phrase describing each instance found - determine which documents contain which instances - bracket each instance in the text of the document in which it was found For each search (by a given participant for a given topic at a given site), NIST will use the submitted list of selected documents and the assessor's instance-document mapping for the topic to calculate: - the fraction of total instances (as determined by the assessor) for the topic that are covered by the submitted documents (i.e., instance recall) - the fraction of the submitted documents which contain one or more instances (i.e., instance precision) The third measure, elapsed clock time, will be taken directly from the submitted results for each search. Experimental design for a site ------------------------------ 1. Minimal experimental matrix as run Define two blocks of four topics each, order of presentation fixed within each block: B1 = T1 -> T2 -> T3 -> T4 365i 357i 362i 352i B2 = T5 -> T6 -> T7 -> T8 366i 392i 387i 353i Participants | System,Topic --------------+-------------------- P1 | E,B1 C,B2 P2 | C,B2 E,B1 P3 | E,B2 C,B1 P4 | C,B1 E,B2 P5 | E,B1 C,B2 P6 | C,B2 E,B1 P7 | E,B2 C,B1 P8 | C,B1 E,B2 or expanded to show the individual topics: Participants | System,Topic combinations --------------+--------------------------------------------------- P1 | E,T1 E,T2 E,T3 E,T4 C,T5 C,T6 C,T7 C,T8 P2 | C,T5 C,T6 C,T7 C,T8 E,T1 E,T2 E,T3 E,T4 P3 | E,T5 E,T6 E,T7 E,T8 C,T1 C,T2 C,T3 C,T4 P4 | C,T1 C,T2 C,T3 C,T4 E,T5 E,T6 E,T7 E,T8 P5 | E,T1 E,T2 E,T3 E,T4 C,T5 C,T6 C,T7 C,T8 P6 | C,T5 C,T6 C,T7 C,T8 E T1 E,T2 E,T3 E,T4 P7 | E,T5 E,T6 E,T7 E,T8 C,T1 C,T2 C,T3 C,T4 P8 | C,T1 C,T2 C,T3 C,T4 E,T5 E,T6 E,T7 E,T8 - E = experimental system - C = Control system - site's choice - The participants (searchers) should be numbered sequentially, 1, ..., J. J must be at least 8 (see part 4 below on how to add more) Each site will randomly assign participants to the rows of its design. The order for presentation of topics to searchers at all participating sites is defined by the above design. The assignment of actual topics to T1, T2, ... T8 will be determined by NIST in collaboration with the track shortly after the interactive topics are made available. For the purposes of analysis each 4-person-by-8-topic matrix defined above will in effect be rearranged by permuting the columns (topics) so E alternates with C as in the following: Participants | System,Topic combinations --------------+--------------------------------------------------- P1 | E,T1 C,T5 E,T2 C,T6 E,T3 C,T7 E,T4 C,T8 P2 | C,T5 E,T1 C,T6 E,T2 C,T7 E,T3 C,T8 E,T4 P3 | E,T5 C,T1 E,T6 C,T2 E,T7 C,T3 E,T8 C,T4 P4 | C,T1 E,T5 C,T2 E,T6 C,T3 E,T7 C,T4 E,T8 Note that this matrix consists of the following 2x2 subdesign: E C C E This 2x2 design is a latin square design. It has the property that the "treatment effect", here E-C, the control-adjusted response, can be estimated free and clear of the main (additive) effects of participant and topic. Here, participant and topic are treated statistically as blocking factors. This means that even in the presence of differences between participants and topics, which clearly are anticipated, the design will provide estimates of E-C that are not contaminated by these differences. However, the estimate of E-C is contaminated by the presence of an interaction between topic and participant. Therefore, we replicate the 2x2 latin square 4x4 times to get the minimal 8x8 design for each site. The contaminating effect of the topic by participant interaction is reduced by averaging the sixteen estimates of E-C that are available, one for each 2x2 latin square. This is analogous to averaging replicate measurements of a single quantity in order to reduce the measurement uncertainty. 2. Augmentation The design for a given site can be augmented in two ways: 1. Participants can be added by in groups of 4 using the design for P1-4 (above). 2. Systems can be added by repeating the 8x8 design with at least one new system. Topics cannot be added/subtracted individually for each site. All augmentations other than the two listed above, however interesting, are outside the scope of this design. If sites plan such adjunct experiments, they are encouraged to design them for maximal synergy with the track design. 3. Analysis Up to each group, but all are strongly encouraged to take advantage of the experimental design and undertake: 1. exploratory data analysis to examine the patterns of correlation, interaction, etc. involving the major factors. Some example plots for the TREC-6 interactive data (recall or precision by searcher or topic) are available on the Interactive Track web site at www-nlpir.nist.gov/~over/t7i under "Interactive Track History". 2. analysis of variance (ANOVA), where appropriate, to estimate the separate contributions of searcher, topic and system as a first step in understanding why the results of one search are different from those of another.

Hubble and the Messier objects
The Hubble Space Telescope and the Messier objects [hst.jpg]
The famous Hubble Space Telescope is certainly one of the most innovative tools of the astronomers in the 1990s decade; the present author is just now going to predict (and is convinced it deserves) that it might win the title "Photographer of the Decade" for the 1990, as Voyager 2 was nominated for the 1980. Its most spectacular results, together with an open and intelligent public relations policy of the Space Telescope Science Institute, has provided astronomers with a great flood of data and high-quality images, and an outstanding popularity, especially as all the materials get public domain two years after they were obtained. The Hubble results have revolutionized the state of knowledge in virtually any branch of astronomy -- not that every good result comes from the HST, but as these data are available publicly, they are used if ever possible; from planets, comets, and asteroids to stars, clusters, nebulae, and galaxies, every sort of objects in the sky were investigated, often obtaining most revolutionary results. Among the most outstanding achievements are observations of objects from Messier's catalog, as those are outstanding representatives of all types of Deep-Sky objects. Because not every author has made his results available to the public domain, we cannot present a comprehensive review here at the moment. But we have tried to link into our catalog some of the most interesting achievements. There's but one fact on the Hubble Telescope's optics which must be kept in mind: The Hubble telescope has a very long focal length of 190 feet (58 m), and thus a one degree field measures one full meter in the space telescope's focal plane, and one arc minute about 1.7 cm. As its detectors are very much smaller, their fields of view are actually small, so that only photos of small portions of extended objects like most of Messier's catalog can be obtained. Moreover, the Hubble Space Telescope is not only an astronomical instrument (though the telescope makes up its biggest part) but also a sophisticated spacecraft. As a spacecraft, it has proven to be very reliable, and was so well operated that the technological operations did virtually never concern the scientific program (at least up to November 1999 when it shut down itself because the fourth of 6 gyroscopes failed - only to be recovered in the third servicing mission, STS-103, in December 1999). The Hubble Space Telescope (HST) was originally projected under the name "Large Space Telescope" (LST) and then simply "Space Telescope" (ST), and developed since the 1970s. Indeed, Hubble is one of the more important in a considerably long list of orbiting telescopes, or astronomy satellites. It is the second of four in a NASA series of large orbiting observatories, observing in the visible light, together with the Compton Gamma Ray Telescope (CGRO) observing in Gamma-ray light, the Chandra X-ray Observatory (CXO), and the Spitzer Space Telescope (SST)
observing in Infrared. Here's a list of links to the Hubble observations of Messier objects we could collect with our pages: M1: Jeff Hester
and Paul Scowen
of the Arizona State University, Tempe, Arizona, have obtained gorgeous images of the Crab Nebula
with the Hubble Space Telescope. These images have been reproduced previously in Sky and Telescope
of January 1995, and have provided some new and significant insight into the internal processes of this supernova remnant. Some views of fine detail
have been extracted, which are e.g. suitable for computer screen background. On May 30, 1996, new studies
of the same authors have provided some new insight into the dynamics and changes of the Crab nebula and its pulsar. Studies of June 2000
of 1995 images reveal details of the Heart of the Crab Nebula. M4: White dwarfs

M51: Hubble photos of M51, especially of its core
("X" or "y" structure in the core of M51) have been taken before and after its repair in December 1993 by the crew of the Space Shuttle mission STS-61. The HST also recorded Supernova 1994I in M51. In 2001, new images of inner spiral arms

M100: This grand-design spiral was among the first objects photographed after the HST refurbishment
by the crew of the Shutle mission STS-61 in December 1993. Moreover, this galaxy is the home of the first Cepheid variables discovered in the Virgo cluster of galaxies, giving a distance of 50-60 million light years, and a Hubble constant of 80+/-17. However, with the refinement of the distance scale by ESA's astrometric Hipparcos satellite, this value must be refined by about 10 percent, and current estimates for H0 are closer to 67+/-7. M104: Hubble Mosaic of the Majestic Sombrero Galaxy. M105: Central Massive Dark Object
(Jan 1997) We know of more good Hubble results concerning Messier objects. They are listed below, and we would like to get images and more information for inclusion here: M95
was a target within the key project of searching for Cepheid variables in neighboring galaxies. We are still looking for Hubble images of this galaxy though. M101: The distance of M101 has been determined as 24 million light years (27 if corrected for Hipparcos data), again with Cepheids. A HST image of M101 was in a semi-recent issue of Astronomy magazine. Also, there were older images which are not yet on SEDS, e.g. in the slide sets of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific, including more photos of M42, M77, M87, and others which still await being included here. Some Hubble images of non-Messier objects have also found their way into our service: NGC 2903

[SpaceDaily Frontpage]
SPACE WIRE Hubble Space Telescope turns 15, with a galaxy of achievements WASHINGTON (AFP) Apr 26, 2005 The Hubble Space Telescope turned 15 Monday, with 750,000 photographs of deep space and Earth to its credit, but its future is now uncertain. Hubble was launched by the Space Shuttle Discovery on April 25, 1990, and opened a new era in astronomy. However, the telescope, a cooperative effort of NASA and the European Space Agency, would not be operational until three years later. A mirror that had been improperly ground was corrected in 1993, when a new camera was also installed in the first repair mission by a space shuttle. Once repaired, the telescope beamed back photographs 10 times sharper than ever before of galaxies, supernovas, giant explosions marking the death of a star and the birth of a black hole. Thanks to Hubble, flying above the atmospheric distortion that hinders even more powerful Earth-based telescopes, scientists have been able to confirm that the universe is rapidly expanding and to calculate precisely its age, at 13.7 billion years, according to NASA. Among other achievements, Hubble's observations allowed scientists to confirm the existence of a strange form of energy called dark energy; proved the existence of super-massive black holes; provided sharp views of a comet hitting Jupiter; and showed that the process of forming planetary systems is common throughout the galaxy, NASA said in a statement. NASA has so far decided not to send a shuttle to repair the aging Hubble, citing the 450 million dollars it would cost to do so. But the space agency's new chief, Michael Griffin, has said he would revisit the decision. Astronauts have serviced Hubble four times, and many scientists hoped that a fifth service mission would be funded to enable Hubble to function to 2011, when its infrared replacement, the James Webb Space Telescope, is scheduled to arrive. Currently, it is believed that Hubble's aging solar cells will provide enough energy to survive to 2007. All rights reserved. © 2005 Agence France-Presse.

By Leonard David, SPACE.com A White House decision to cut funding for a Hubble Space Telescope servicing mission and dump the observatory into a remote stretch of ocean waters at a future date is sure to incite debate in scientific, engineering, and policy making circles. The Hubble Space Telescope snaps a view of Senegal. The telescope is in need of service, which is not in the current NASA budget.
NASA/JSC
Intensive work has been underway at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center to develop telerobotic servicing skills for the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) in the event that a space shuttle crew is never again sent to the orbiting facility. Aerospace firms in the United States and in Canada have teamed with NASA to develop a Hubble Robotic Vehicle Deorbit Module. Either a robotic or shuttle-based servicing option reportedly would cost in excess of $1 billion. That pricetag is viewed by the White House, according to sources, as not affordable given other high-priority and more expensive efforts, such as the return-to-flight of the space shuttle program, as well as moving forward on NASA's Moon, Mars and beyond agenda. White House plans to scuttle Hubble is part of NASA's 2006 budget request, sources said, with some money in the budget allocated to using a propulsion module coupled to Hubble for its safe but destructive deorbiting. The cutting of the HST servicing mission from NASA's 2006 budget request was first reported by Space News on its Web site Friday and on SPACE.com. Leading the fight
Senator Barbara Mikulski (D-Md.), a fervent Hubble supporter whose state is home to both the Goddard Space Flight Center and the Space Telescope Science Institute, issued a statement late January 21 in which she vowed to continue advocating an HST servicing mission. "It is essential that we have a safe and reliable servicing mission to Hubble," Mikulski said, that is consistent with the findings of the Columbia Accident Investigation Board and last month's findings of a National Academy of Sciences (NAS) panel on the Hubble issue. On December 8, in the NAS final report released by the Committee on the Assessment of Options for Extending the Life of the Hubble Space Telescope, a blue ribbon group of experts said that NASA should reinstate a space shuttle mission to refurbish the Earth-orbiting telescope. "I led the fight to add $300 million to NASA's budget last year for a Hubble servicing mission, and I plan to lead the fight again this year. This is what the American people expect and deserve," Mikulski said in a statement. In defense of Hubble
Response to the White House decision has engendered a wait-and-see attitude in some astronomical quarters, while others have been quick to react. Hubble's best days lie ahead, predicted John Bahcall, a professor of natural sciences at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey. In 1998, he was a recipient of the National Medal of Science for his pioneering efforts in neutrino astrophysics and his contributions to the development and planning of the Hubble Space Telescope. "President Nixon cancelled in 1973 the Hubble Telescope while it was still in the development phase. The reason was similar: other activities in the NASA budget took priority," Bahcall told SPACE.com. "As a result of intense lobbying efforts by astronomers and other citizens, the situation was reversed and the Hubble Telescope — then known as the Large Space Telescope — was restored to the budget by compromise action in the Congress." Bahcall said that Hubble has contributed enormously to scientific knowledge and to America's respect abroad. The telescope represents achievements of which all Americans can be proud, he said. "I am confident that Americans of all walks of life will come to the defense of the Hubble and cause the Congress to restore the repair of the telescope to the NASA budget," Bahcall said. Telerobotic progress
Excellent progress is being made on a telerobotic approach to servicing the Hubble, said Jim Crocker, vice president of civil space at Lockheed Martin Space Systems of Denver. The firm has supported NASA's planning and then repair and servicing of the HST via four space shuttle missions to date. The telerobotics team at work at Goddard Space Flight Center "have a good shot at pulling this off," Crocker told SPACE.com the day before the Space News story on the White House HST decision appeared. Lockheed Martin's role in the rocket-launched Hubble Robotic Vehicle Deorbit Module (HRVDM), Crocker said, is providing all the sensors to do the rendezvous and docking with the Hubble, as well as provide the liquid-fueled propellant module that would later deorbit the telescope. For their part, Canada's MacDonald, Dettwiler and Associates (MDA) Ltd. — through its MD Robotics group in Brampton, Ontario — is providing the Dextre robot that's part of the HRVDM. It is being specially configured to replace batteries, gyroscopes, and perhaps an instrument on the HST to extend its life. NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center is overseeing and integrating the HRVDM work. Crocker said that simulations performed at NASA's Goddard Space Flight center have converted doubters, including him, that performing many of the scheduled Hubble servicing tasks through the tender loving care of telerobotics is feasible. "That's not to say it's not challenging," Crocker said, "but the team is making a convincing story." Rabbit out of the hat
There's also good news to report in keeping Hubble in an operating mode. Worry centers on HST's gyroscopes, batteries, or other gear that might fail early, negating the observatory's useful lifetime. "The team continues to pull rabbits out of the hat," Crocker said. For instance, a two gyro science mode, along with the needed software has been worked out. HST's original design had to have three gyros working to do science. Additionally, a new battery management approach is being adopted. "That's good news," Crocker said. "I'm hearing we're likely to be able to get [HST] into 2008 now." At the end of the day, Crocker concluded, whatever option is decided upon for Hubble servicing and its ultimate reentry, "everyone on the team wants the best chance of success possible."

The Hubble Space Telescope
by Jim Slotta Scientist
Telescopes have come a long way since the days of Galileo! Over the years, larger and larger telescopes were constructed in order to capture the light from more and more distant stars. Still, no matter how large a lens or mirror was used, there was always a problem with any telescope located on the surface of the earth, as the earth's atmosphere tends to block or absorb some of the starlight. Because the light from distant stars is very faint to begin with, this interference from the atmosphere became a serious problem as scientists looked further and further out into space. For decades, astronomers longed for a telescope that was free from the earth's atmospheric blockade -- on the surface of the moon, perhaps, or in orbit around the earth as a satellite. In 1993, they were finally rewarded, as NASA engineers delivered the orbiting Hubble Space Telescope: (Medium, 57K)
Originally, the giant light-collecting mirror of the Hubble was slightly out of shape, which meant that the images of far-off stars were out of focus. But when space shuttle astronauts repaired this problem in December of 1993, a whole new chapter in the book of astronomy had begun. One newspaper reporter wrote: "The Hubble Space Telescope, once blurry and the butt of jokes, has been repaired, making it sharp enough to see two fireflies 10 feet apart in Tokyo from Washington DC. It is sensitive enough to detect their individual flashes." --The San Fransisco Examiner
The Hubble can look at galaxies which are very old as described in an article from Philadelphia's daily newspaper, the Philadelphia Inquirer.: "...scientists announced they had pictures of galaxies so distant that the light from them had taken billions of years to reach Hubble's cameras. The telescope was therefore seeing how the galaxies looked when they were young-it was watching the past unfold." --The Philadelphia Inquirer
(Check out the Philadelphia Inquirer article to learn all about the Hubble telescope, including some of its major successes as a scientific instrument.) Evidence Information KEYWORDS Telescope, Hubble, Light, Space, Astronomy SUBMITTER Philip Bell Additional Information METHODS The evidence combines NASA photos of the Hubble with a quote from a newspaper and an informative article about the Hubble telescope's history and various achievements. This informative article, written by a Philadelphia Inquirer reporter, contains some interesting links to other related Web sites. INSPIRATION This evidence about the Hubble Space Telescope was assembled in order to provide some information about the problems with conventional telescopes and how they have been overcome. PROJECTS How Far Does Light Go? GUIDANCE - Why does the fact that the Hubble is outside of the Earth's atmosphere make a difference in what it allows us to see? - Does the fact that the Hubble can see light from galaxies which has traveled in space for billions of years support either theory in the debate? - How far away can the Hubble see stars? What does that say about the light coming from these stars? - The article tells us that the Hubble has allowed astronomers to learn more about distant galaxies. Why does it say the Hubble was seeing the galaxies as they appeared when they were very young? - Could a telescope on the earth's surface with a really huge and precise mirror or lens detect the things the Hubble is detecting? Why or why not? COMPREHENSION TIME 5 to 20 minutes SCIENCE LEVEL Middle School and Above KIE Evidence. Copyright © 1996-7 The KIE Group.

PLANETARIUM UNVEILS NEW MURAL-SIZED IMAGES TAKEN BY HUBBLE SPACE TELESCOPE Visitors will be able to witness a spectacular event at 1 p.m. April 25 at the University of Nebraska State Museum's Mueller Planetarium when two new mural-sized images taken by NASA's Hubble Space Telescope will be unveiled to the public. The stunning photographs of spiral galaxy M51 and an eerie-looking tower of gas in the Eagle Nebula commemorate Hubble's 15 years of viewing the heavens. Lincoln Mayor Coleen Seng will unveil the images. Also presenting remarks will be: Harvey Perlman, UNL chancellor, Prem Paul, vice chancellor for research, Priscilla Grew, museum director, and Jack Dunn, planetarium coordinator. The event is open to the public. No museum admission will be charged during the unveiling and reception following. The 4-foot by 6-foot image of M51 reveals striking details of how clusters of stars are born in the galaxy's long, curving spiral arms. The 3-foot by 6-foot photograph of the Eagle Nebula shows a gaseous formation sculpted by ultraviolet light from a group of massive, hot, young stars. These views are among the largest and sharpest images ever taken by the Hubble telescope and show the awesome beauty of space. The Earth-orbiting observatory was deployed in space on April 25, 1990. Hubble orbits above Earth's murky atmosphere, which distorts light from celestial objects. During its 15 years of viewing the universe, the Hubble telescope has taken more than 700,000 snapshots of celestial objects such as galaxies, dying stars and giant gas clouds, the birthplace of stars. Additional information about the Hubble Space Telescope is available at http://hubblesite.org. The new Hubble images will remain on display in the Mueller Planetarium lobby. The planetarium is located at the University of Nebraska State Museum in Morrill Hall on the UNL campus, just south of 14th and Vine streets. Admission: $8 family, $4 adult, $2 child, free with a UNL ID. Free visitor parking in front of Morrill Hall. Museum hours are Monday through Saturday from 9:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. and Sundays and holidays 1:30 p.m. to 4:30 p.m. HUBBLE TRIVIA 2005 In its 15 years of viewing the sky, NASA's Hubble Space Telescope has taken more than 700,000 exposures and probed more than 22,000 celestial objects. The Hubble Ultra Deep Field (HUDF) is the most observed area of the sky. Hubble spent more than 500 hours viewing the HUDF, snapping more than 1,100 photographs. Hubble has whirled around Earth nearly 88,000 times, racking up 2.3 billion miles. That is like making about 400,000 round trips from New York City to Los Angeles. The telescope's observations have produced 23 terabytes of data, equal to the amount of text in 23 million novels. The Hubble data would fill two Library of Congress book collections. Each day the orbiting observatory generates enough data -- about 15 gigabytes -- to fill more than three DVDs. In Hubble's 15-year lifetime, about 3,900 astronomers from all over the world have used the telescope to probe the universe. Astronomers have published more than 4,000 scientific papers on Hubble results. HUBBLE SPACE TELESCOPE'S TOP 10 GREATEST ACHIEVEMENTS When Galileo used his homemade telescope 400 years ago to view mountains on the Moon, satellites circling Jupiter, and myriad stars in our Milky Way Galaxy, he launched a revolution that changed our view of an Earth-centered universe. The launch of NASA's Hubble Space Telescope aboard the space shuttle Discovery 15 years ago initiated another revolution in astronomy. For the first time, a large telescope that sees in visible light began orbiting above Earth's distorting atmosphere, which blurs starlight and makes images appear fuzzy. Astronomers anticipated great discoveries from Hubble. The telescope has delivered as promised and continues serving up new discoveries. Astronomers and astrophysicists using Hubble data have published more than 4,000 scientific papers, on topics from the solar system to the very distant universe. The following list highlights some of Hubble's greatest achievements. The Universe is Caught Speeding Hubble played a key role in discovering that a mysterious form of energy called dark energy is acting like a cosmic gas pedal, accelerating the universe's expansion rate. Dark energy shoves galaxies away from each other at ever-increasing speeds and works in opposition to gravity. Hubble observations of distant exploding stars called supernovas placed the most significant constraints to date on the nature of dark energy, revealing that it does appear to be a constant presence as first anticipated early last century by scientist Albert Einstein. Astronomers understand almost nothing about dark energy, even though it appears to comprise about 70 percent of the universe. Tell Us Your Age Some people hate to reveal their age, and the universe, it seems, is no different. Before Hubble was launched, astronomers had been trying for several years to pin down the universe's age. They came up with a wide age range, 10 to 20 billion years. One of Hubble's key duties was to help astronomers determine a precise age for the universe. The telescope helped astronomers accomplish that goal, narrowing the universe's age to 13 to 14 billion years old, an accuracy of about 10 percent. Astronomers made observations of Cepheid variable stars -- pulsating stars used to measure vast distances -- in the Virgo and other clusters to establish the expansion rate and the universe's age. Postcards from the Edge of Space Hubble provided astronomers with a "scrapbook" full of snapshots of the early universe. The scrapbook photographs revealed "toddler" galaxies that existed billions of years ago when the universe was young. The telescope snapped the pictures of the "deep" universe in a series of unique observations, the Hubble Deep Fields, the Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey, and the Hubble Ultra Deep Field. The observations provided the deepest view of the cosmos in visible, ultraviolet, and near-infrared light. In the most recent foray into the farthest regions of the universe, Hubble uncovered 10,000 galaxies, some of which existed 400 to 800 million years after the Big Bang. Unlike our Milky Way Galaxy, the galaxies spied in the Hubble observations take many other shapes. Some are shaped like toothpicks, others like links on a bracelet. Through these observations, astronomers can follow the evolution of the star-formation rate and witness how galaxies form. By studying galaxies at different eras, astronomers can see how galaxies change over time. Worlds Beyond Our Sun Astronomers using ground-based telescopes to hunt for planets outside our solar system, or extrasolar planets, have nabbed more than 100 alien worlds. But they needed the keen "eye" of Hubble to make the first direct measurement of the chemical makeup of an extrasolar planet's atmosphere. The telescope detected the elements sodium, hydrogen, carbon, and oxygen in the atmosphere of a Jupiter-sized planet. The unique observation demonstrates that Hubble and other telescopes can sample the chemical makeup of the atmospheres of alien worlds. Astronomers could use the same technique someday to determine whether life exists on extrasolar planets. Besides testing the atmosphere of an extrasolar planet, Hubble also made precise measurements of the masses of two distant worlds. Astronomers believe that one of those worlds is the oldest known planet. The planet, whose estimated age is 13 billion years, is more than twice as old as 4.5-billion-year-old Earth. Monster Black Holes Are Everywhere The hubs of most galaxies have a mammoth resident that loves to gobble up anything that wanders near it. This sleeping monster, Hubble observations confirmed, is a black hole with a mass millions to billions times that of our Sun. Not only are black holes everywhere, but they also have an intimate relationship with their host galaxies. Hubble observations revealed that a tight relationship exists between the masses of the central black holes and those of the galactic bulges of old stars, gas, and dust that surround them. Monstrous galaxies, for example, have titanic black holes. This close relationship may be evidence that black holes grew with their galaxies, feasting on a measured diet of gas and stars swirling around the hearts of those galaxies. The Biggest "Bangs" Since the Big Bang Imagine a powerful burst of light and other radiation that can burn away the ozone in Earth's atmosphere. Luckily, bursts of light that strong occur so far away they will not scorch our planet. These bursts of light are called gamma-ray bursts. They may represent the most powerful explosions in the universe since the Big Bang, the explosive birth of our universe. Hubble images showed that these brief flashes of radiation come from far-flung galaxies that are forming stars at enormously high rates. By pinpointing the host galaxies, Hubble also identified the sources of the "bursts": the collapse of massive stars. Quasars, the Light Fantastic Quasars have been so elusive and mysterious that the hunt to define them would have taxed even the superior analytical skills of detective Sherlock Holmes. Since their discovery in 1963, astronomers have been trying to crack the mystery of how these compact dynamos of light and other radiation, which lie at the outer reaches of the universe, produce so much energy. Quasars are no larger than our solar system but outshine galaxies of hundreds of billions of stars. These light beacons have left trails of evidence and plenty of clues, but scientists have only just begun to understand their behavior. Astronomers using Hubble tracked down the "homes" of quasars, proving that these dynamos reside in the centers of galaxies. Planet Construction Zones Peering into the gaseous clouds in the Milky Way Galaxy where stars are born, Hubble discovered that many young stars are surrounded by flattened disks of gas and dust. These disks, now known as "proplyds" (short for protoplanetary disks), are the likely birthplaces of new planetary systems. Hubble provided visual proof that pancake-shaped dust disks around young stars are common, suggesting that the building blocks for planet formation are in place. A Shattered Comet Rocks Jupiter Imagine setting off every atomic bomb on Earth all at once. Now imagine repeating such an apocalyptic explosion two dozen times in a week! Unleashing such energy would destroy Earth's surface, but the giant planet Jupiter hardly flinched when it underwent such a catastrophe in 1994. Hubble provided a ringside seat to a once-in-a-millennium event when two dozen chunks of a comet smashed into Jupiter. Hubble provided dramatic images of massive explosions that sent towering mushroom-shaped fireballs of hot gas into the Jovian sky. The doomed comet, called Shoemaker-Levy 9, had been pulled apart two years earlier by Jupiter's gravity. Each impact left temporary black sooty scars in Jupiter's planetary clouds. Going Out in a Blaze of Glory A Sun-like star's death is as colorful as maple leaves in autumn. Sun-like stars die gracefully by ejecting their outer gaseous layers into space. Eventually, the outer layers begin to glow in vibrant colors of red, blue, and green. The colorful glowing shroud is called a planetary nebula. Hubble revealed unprecedented details of this process. Ground-based images suggested that many of these objects had simple shapes, but Hubble showed that their shapes are more complex. Hubble's keen "eye" disclosed that planetary nebulas are like snowflakes: no two are alike. Turning its vision to the tattered remains of a massive star that exploded as a supernova in 1987, Hubble found three mysterious rings of material encircling the doomed star. During the years since the eruption, Hubble spied brightened spots on the middle ring caused by material ejected from the explosion slamming into it. Home

Insurance Group Names Most Dangerous Vehicles 03.16.2005
By James M. Flammang
According to the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety
(IIHS), a version of the Chevrolet Blazer
may be the most unsafe vehicle to be found on American roads. Based on the Institute's study of 1999-2002 passenger vehicles, the two-door, two-wheel-drive Blazer had the highest rate of driver deaths, in both single-vehicle and multiple-vehicle accidents. While the average annual driver death rate was 87 per million registered vehicles, the two-door Blazer averaged 308 deaths per million. Rollover accidents also topped the list of 199 vehicle models, at 251 per million. Models with the highest death rates are "mostly small cars and mid-sized SUVs," the Institute asserted. The list of vehicles with high rates also included the Mitsubishi Mirage
two-door sedan, with 209 driver deaths per million vehicles, followed by the Pontiac Firebird, subcompact Kia Rio, and first-generation Kia Sportage
with two-wheel drive. Several sport-utility vehicles showed low rates. Judged by IIHS results, the safest vehicle of all could be the Mercedes-Benz E-Class
sedan, with a driver death rate of 10 per million. Next came the Toyota 4Runner
midsize SUV, Volkswagen Passat
sedan, and Lexus RX 300
(another midsize SUV). Also on the list vehicles with low death rates was the Toyota RAV4, which is a compact sport-utility vehicle. Several of the models with high driver death rates have already ceased production, and the Blazer is being phased out of Chevrolet's lineup. Kia now markets a completely different Sportage model. General Motors responded to the IIHS report by stating that the Blazer was properly tested while in production. GM also questions "what role driver behavior, such as drunk driving and driving without a safety belt, played in these deaths." Trucks, according to a GM statement, are driven more than cars, "often on secondary roads where more rollover crashes occur." The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, which conducts crash tests and engages in safety research, is affiliated with the insurance industry.

Sure it guzzles gas, blocks visibility and is a rather inefficient method of moving singles around a metropolitan area, but "the world's most dangerous vehicle"? Give me a break! Carmudgeon
Why Do You Hate the SUV?
Date Posted 11-01-2002 This month's topic comes courtesy of the September 16, 2002, issue of Automotive News
(with a follow-up story covering the same topic in the October 7 issue). Before getting into the meat of my discussion, I think it bears mentioning that, despite the title, Automotive News
is not a 100-percent, over-the-top, prays-to-the-gods-of-internal-combustion, pro-automotive periodical. This publication, which arrives in my mailbox every Monday morning, generally does an adequate job of presenting both sides of any given topic related to the industry in which I work. However, after reading the "Chorus of SUV critics grows louder" story in the September 16 issue, and then the "Author bases anti-SUV conclusions on statistics" article from the October 7 issue, I felt it was time to address this latest anti-SUV tirade. As someone who finds plenty wrong with the current SUV situation, as chronicled in my column last March, you SUV haters can rest easy knowing I'm never going to defend any of the hypocrites who buy an SUV when they don't need one. What I am going to defend is every American's right to buy an SUV if he wants to, whether he needs it or not.
In both of the Automotive News
stories I've referenced above a gentleman named Keith Bradsher is cited as leading the charge to educate consumers about the real dangers of SUVs. Mr. Bradsher's book, High and Mighty ? SUVs: The World's Most Dangerous Vehicles and How They Got That Way
has an interesting title, though I wonder if "High and Mighty" refers to SUVs or the liberal intelligentsia that often goes around this country trying to "protect us from ourselves for our own good." In this case, I'm inclined to believe the latter simply because Mr. Bradsher partakes of the exact same type of double-talk he claims to be fighting against. Specifically, Mr. Bradsher takes issue with how the automakers paint SUVs as safe, rugged off-road vehicles capable of providing fun and adventure to their owners, even though most of those owners will never go off-road. He thinks the poor American consumer is being duped into buying SUVs by the big, mean automakers that are only interested in making a profit off of these rolling death traps that use too much gas. According to the October 7 issue of Automotive News, Bradsher thinks automakers "manipulate automotive journalists by setting up press events for sport-utilities in exotic off-road locations when they know the vehicle won't be driven that way." It further states "this distracts reviewers from evaluating the vehicles where most people drive them." Wow, and I always thought my staff did a pretty good job of identifying how even the most capable off-road vehicles will rarely be driven off-road by the average owner. Now I learn that my entire editorial team has been carefully "manipulated" by those dastardly automakers. (Can you hear the "protecting us from ourselves" overtones yet?) Thankfully, we all have someone like Mr. Bradsher to shine the light of truth on this otherwise dark and sinister plot, right? Well, not really. When Bradsher says that SUVs use more gas than other types of vehicles, he's generally correct, although many compact, and even some midsize SUVs, can get better mileage than midsize and larger sedans. But where Bradsher clearly crosses the line into deceitful reporting is his assertions that SUVs are inherently dangerous. Indeed, the title of his book calls them "The World's Most Dangerous Vehicles." If you're hearing echoes of Ralph Nader's exuberantly alarmist Unsafe at Any Speed
book from 40 years ago, you're on the right track. To justify his branding of SUVs as the modern-day Corvair, Bradsher points to accident and injury rates that show SUVs being involved in more crashes than full-size sedans or minivans. He specifically cited this point in an interview on Fox's "The O'Reilly Factor" with Bill O'Reilly. But as anyone with basic PR training knows, you can make statistics say whatever you want them to. Saying that SUVs are more dangerous than full-size sedans simply because they are involved in more accidents is like saying people who fly on airplanes are more likely to die in an air disaster when compared to people who never fly. That statement may seem overly simplistic but, remember, people on the ground occasionally die in air disasters, too. The point is that the nature of the driver (just like the nature of people who do or don't fly) is critically important in both arguments. To put it another way, look at the type of people who drive full-size sedans and minivans. In case you don't already know, full-sedans, like the Ford Crown Victoria, Buick Regal or Toyota Avalon, tend to be driven by people over 50. And minivans tend to be driven by parents transporting children (increasingly, minivans are also being driven by people over 50 who have discovered how convenient those huge sliding doors are when it comes time to get in and out of the vehicle ? my in-laws and their Oldsmobile Silhouette being a perfect example). SUVs, on the other hand, tend to be driven by young people, and they often serve as a sort of rolling party because they can carry many bodies (like a minivan) and they have a cool image (pretty much the opposite of a minivan). Yes, lots of housewives have traded in their minivans for an SUV in recent years. But minivans accounted for just over one million in U.S. sales last year, while SUVs accounted for nearly four million. Obviously, it's not just suburban moms who buy these high-profile vehicles. So you have grandparents and parents almost exclusively driving large sedans and minivans, while over in SUV land you have plenty of young, single people carrying all their friends to and from the latest social gathering. And, lo and behold, SUVs have a higher accident rate and injury rate than large sedans and minivans. Bradsher seems to have left this minor point out of his various media interviews. I'd hate to suggest he's using deceptive tactics to make a point and sell a product (sort of like touting the off-road prowess of certain vehicles that will likely never go off-road) but, oh, what the hell, I'm gonna say it anyway. And I'll present this counter argument to Bradsher: If you take two equally skilled, competent and intelligent drivers, and put one in a Lincoln Navigator and the other in a Lincoln LS, the driver in the Navigator is less likely to suffer serious injuries from a traffic accident. Keep in mind that competent and intelligent drivers always wear their seatbelt and understand that SUVs don't handle like a sports car. Or try this one on for size: You have just been told by the Great Spirit that in the next seven days you will be involved in a serious traffic accident. You don't know where, you don't know when, and you don't know the specific nature of the crash, but it will happen. The only factor you can control is what vehicle you will be driving for the next week ? Cadillac Escalade, Honda Odyssey or Toyota Avalon. Which one do you pick, Mr. Bradsher? Keep in mind that the two vehicles you don't
pick will also be involved in the accident. If Bradsher wants to make an argument that it's easier for bad drivers to crash in an SUV than in a minivan, I might actually go along with that argument. But that doesn't make the SUV "the world's most dangerous vehicle," it simply proves what we already knew: even a large, heavy vehicle can't save lousy drivers from themselves. Another point Bradsher fails to mention is the increasingly carlike nature of SUVs. In the last two years, Ford's best-selling SUVs, the Explorer and Expedition, went from riding on a solid rear axle to utilizing an independent rear suspension. This move greatly increased the stability of both vehicles. How do we know this? Well, beyond simple logic and some instrumented testing under controlled conditions, one of our editors recently had to perform a rapid lane change maneuver in our long-term Explorer
after an accident happened right in front of him on a Los Angeles freeway. He swerved hard left and then hard right, recreating the exact driving style that had previous Ford Explorers going rubber side up. In this instance, the 2002 Explorer remained stable and composed. Once again, not bad for being one of "the world's most dangerous vehicles," huh? I'll concede Bradsher's point that most SUV owners never go off-road, and I agree with him that automakers (especially domestic automakers) have more to gain by selling high-priced, high-profit SUVs instead of lower-priced cars. But, as is usually the case, market forces are addressing these issues. Today's SUV buyers demand a more refined and stable vehicle. Foreign automakers were the first ones to offer carlike SUVs, but the domestic manufacturers are quickly catching up (with models like the redesigned Explorer and Expedition). As for vehicle emissions and gas mileage, SUVs are making rapid advances in both areas as well. Honda's new Pilot already has ULEV (ultra low emissions vehicle) certification, and it gets 17/22 miles-per-gallon in city/highway driving (numbers not far behind the minivans and full-size sedans Bradsher has such an affinity for). What Bradsher and the rest of this country's SUV haters need to realize is that the genie is out of the bottle. Fifteen years ago most Americans didn't know what an SUV was, and they certainly didn't realize the kind of people-/cargo-carrying capacity such vehicles offered. They also didn't know how reassuring it feels to sit high above the road surface. Now every American over the age of 10 has either driven or ridden in an SUV, and while most may not like the tippy handling or harsh ride over broken pavement, they love the "king of the road" sensation and versatile seating/cargo options. They also like knowing that, if they wanted to, they could scamper away from the beaten path for an off-road adventure. Unlike Mr. Frost, most will never actually take that road less traveled, but we Americans like having our options open. Once again, I want to emphasize that SUVs are not for everyone, and, like any good American, I don't support single, city-dwelling, white-collar professionals, especially ones that rarely carry more than a briefcase or purse and never go off-road, buying seven-passenger vehicles that get less than 20 mpg. However, my reasoning relates to efficiency and geopolitical circumstances (it'd be good not to further grow our dependence on imported oil). However, I'm not going to sell the public a bunch of misinformation about SUVs being inherently unsafe because, well, they aren't. I also don't appreciate all the hypocritical Hollywood "environmentalists" who claim allegiance to Mother Earth?from the cockpits of their Range Rovers, Navigators and Hummer H2s. Of course, regardless of my or Bradsher's desire to see fewer SUVs on the road, the truth is that these vehicles are not going away. They will undoubtedly continue to get even safer, more refined and more fuel-efficient, but they will never disappear from the American landscape. If that thought bothers you, well, now you know how I've felt for the past two decades about rap music. Rather ironic, actually, when you consider the growing bond between certain SUVs and rap music. But hey, at least SUVs will be getting more
refined as the years pass.

Blazer Most Dangerous Vehicle, Insurance Study Finds March 15, 2005
The Mercedes E-Class sedan is the safest car on the highway, while the least safe is the two-door Chevrolet Blazer, according to a study by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS). The institute reached its conclusions about the Mercedes, Blazer and 197 other relatively popular vehicles by studying driver death rates of 1999 to 2002 model cars and trucks from 2000 to 2003. Among four-door midsize cars, the Volkswagen Passat performed best, with an average of 16 driver deaths per million registered vehicles annually, but the Chrysler Sebring had 126 driver deaths. Among midsize sport utility vehicles with four-wheel drive, the Toyota 4Runner had 12 deaths per million registered vehicles annually, compared with 134 for the two-door Ford Explorer. The study focused on the rate of driver deaths in various types of crashes, including both single- and multiple-vehicle accidents. The overall driver death rate, for 199 models studied during the 2000-2003 calendar years, was 87 per million registered vehicles annually, the institute said. The Blazer had an average of 308 driver deaths per million. It also had the highest rate of driver deaths in rollover accidents at 251 per million. "Large cars and minivans dominate among vehicle models with very low death rates" while those with the highest fatality rates are "mostly small cars and small and midsize SUVs," the study said The Results Lowest Rates of Driver Death

Why an SUV is now the most dangerous vehicle in Iraq
Patrick Graham in Baghdad Sunday April 4, 2004 The Observer
It has become clear in the past few years that four-wheel-drive SUVs are some of the most dangerous vehicles on the road. Nowhere is this more true than in Iraq. In almost every deadly attack on foreign civilians, the victims have been in Sport Utility Vehicles, almost invariably white: the occupation car of choice. The burning wreckage in Falluja last week was unmistakable. The charred bodies of the four Americans were scattered around two white SUVs. The men - Scott Helvenston, from Florida, a producer of extreme fitness videos; Jerry Zovko from Ohio; Wesley Batalona, 48, from Hawaii; and wrestling coach Michael Teague, 38, from Tennessee - were former US special forces members now working for Blackwater, a private security firm that protects Paul Bremer, the coalition's administrator. Falluja is a centre of the anti-American resistance, where even the police don't support the Americans. US soldiers don't drive through Falluja much. When they do, they have helicopter back-up and heavy armour. 'Almost every foreigner who has been killed here is an idiot,' said one ex-Navy SEAL. Soldiers often show little sympathy for those who fail to follow the right procedure. He began listing their mistakes. To start with, they were in Falluja, in an SUV. Next, he guessed they had gone through the city before and had met no problems, but were seen leaving an American base - a routine can kill you. Later, they were followed. 'People don't realise that this is war,' he said. But last week's horrific scenes in Falluja give the wrong impression. Iraq is, in fact, a lot safer than it was last summer. There is less violence now but it is better organised, more methodical. Especially in the capital. You can tell a lot about the security situation in Baghdad by listening to the city. Last summer, there was almost constant gunfire. The city was in chaos and murders and robbery were common. Today, there are police on the streets and it is much safer. The problem is that, while the police presence reduces some kinds of crime, there is nobody in control of the city. For a careful criminal, there are no consequences. The other day, we drove by a café in which gangsters hang out. If someone wants to kill you, this is where they can go. It costs $100 to have someone shot. The killers know they will never be caught. For all the media reports about foreign deaths, life is far more dangerous for Iraqis, especially Iraqis who work for foreigners. And while three journalists have been killed in the past month, they have all been killed by the American army. And they were Arab or Iraqi. This is what Iraqis complain about when they say ' maku amin ', no security. If you anger somebody, he can kill you with impunity. A foreign newspaper bureau here recently tried to fire one of its guards for sleeping on the job. A driver quietly explained that, if the guard were fired, he would hire someone to take revenge. The guard stayed. If you can't threaten someone with a vendetta, then you have very little leverage in negotiations. As a result, the tribeless Christian community has been one of the worst hit by kidnappers. In Baghdad, we listen to bombs exploding rather than chaotic gunfire. One woke us up last week, rattling the windows, blowing in the curtains. Five Iraqis were killed. What were they driving? An SUV. ·
Two attacks on Iraqi police south of Baghdad yesterday left four dead, bringing to 350 the number of policemen killed by shooting and suicide bombings in the past year. Special report

“WHAT WOULD SATAN DRIVE?” AND OTHER UNFAIR QUESTIONS ABOUT SUVs The SUV Problem—Hating Them is Too Simplistic
Given a choice, we suspect that Satan would enjoy driving any vehicle with a Burst Into Flames feature. In any event, should today's SUV drivers be condemned to Dante's 7th circle of Hell (the one known as "Yugo")? SUV bashing has become a popular sport among some. SUVs typically get poor gas mileage, they pollute more than cars, they're more [picture of pristine mountain lake]
dangerous in crashes (both for their occupants and especially for drivers of other vehicles). All these things are true. But in some ways, it is too simplistic to say that SUVs are bad and cars are good. For instance, how many of us are driving the most fuel-efficient, least polluting vehicle available on the market? In addition, other factors—such as how far we choose to commute to work, whether or not we carpool, whether or not we combine trips for errands, whether we're still driving a 15-year-old "blue smoker"—all play a role in determining our personal "driving impact" on the environment. If environmental impact is evaluated for all drivers, SUV owners are likely to score more poorly because of the gas-mileage deficit of the typical SUV as compared to a car. Don't forget, though—some SUVs get better gas mileage than some cars. In the 2004 fuel economy guide released by the US EPA and DOE, the Toyota RAV4 had the highest fuel economy in the SUV category, getting 24 mpg, whereas the best of the large cars, the Chevrolet Malibu, got only 22 mpg. The 2004 vehicle with the worst gas mileage was a car—the Lamborghini L-147, which got only 9 mpg. What??? Is Grinning Planet giving a free pass to purchasers of 6,000-pound gas-guzzling behemoths and other SUVs? No way. Most purchasers of such vehicles don't actually NEED them, and putting status, ego, or macho-ness—or, even worse, exploitation of a tax loophole—above reduction of pollution and imported oil use does indeed deserve scorn. But even if the front part of the Line of People Whose Vehicles and Driving Habits Need Improving is predominantly SUV drivers, all of us can ask ourselves [picture of pristine mountain lake]
whether we can do more to reduce gasoline usage and pollution by purchasing a more environmentally friendly vehicle or developing greener driving habits. And now, for the REAL villains in this debate; those old stand-bys we all love to jab at: Congress and the White House. And we don't just mean the current Congress and White House. For the last dozen years, our elected leaders, in concert with our never-admit-anything-can-be-improved auto manufacturers, have squashed attempts to significantly raise fuel economy standards. This is particularly irksome when it comes to SUVs, since they are driven like cars but are not held to the same gas-mileage standards as cars. We payers-at-the-pump and breathers-of-the-air should be outraged that fuel economy standards have not risen significantly for both SUVs AND cars. It's shameful that the average vehicle today gets worse gas mileage than the average vehicle in 1980. The argument that SUVs and minivans will be unaffordable or unmanufacturable if they are made more fuel efficient is the same sort of gloom-and-doom scaremongering that manufacturers put forth in the 1970s when fuel-economy and pollution standards were first proposed. Car makers CAN apply such measures to SUVs and minivans, and they should. The Union of Concerned Scientists recently designed two SUVs that were safer and more fuel efficient than today's models—without sacrificing size or performance. (See the UCS report here)
Whether you're an anti-SUV crusader who calls them "F-U Vs" or you're an SUV owner who drives one with pride, we should be able to agree that keeping reasonable style and performance choices in the vehicle fleet and making all vehicles safer, more fuel-efficient, and less polluting are both worthwhile and compatible goals. Publish date: 11-DEC-2003
BRAIN FOOD It is worth noting that although the Toyota RAV4 has slightly better gasoline costs and lower carbon dioxide emissions than the Chevrolet Malibu, it gets worse ratings for emissions of carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, and hydrocarbons.   You can get Grinning Planet free via email each week

  High and Mighty: SUVs—The World's Most Dangerous Vehicles and How They Got That Way
by Keith Bradsher (Non-Fiction)   DESCRIPTION Just what is it that some people hate so much about SUVs? For Keith Bradsher, it's a number of things; but let's start with their gas-guzzling obesity, their higher pollution levels, and their poor safety ratings on the road. Bradsher is also critical of the devious way Detroit has marketed SUVs and slipped them past many of the regulations that apply to "the rest of us," and he's non-too-happy about how our politicians and regulators have let it happen. But this book is not just a rant—it uses facts to make the case. You'll have to read it for yourself to decide whether SUVs really are the world's most dangerous vehicles.

  PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENT   Hey, we don't pick the Google ads!   – GP     "Even though cars get worse gas mileage than two decades ago, they actually have become much more efficient. The problem is that the efficiency went into more power and larger, heavier vehicles, not into fuel economy. If all of the technological efficiency improvements had gone into efficiency, miles per gallon would be significantly higher than they are today." — Neal Elliott, American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy

Motorcycles Remain Most Dangerous Vehicles NHTSA Announces Discretionary Cooperative Agreements For Research Under The Crash Injury Research And Engineering Network (CIREN) HRSA To Update State-By-State Self Assessments Of Trauma Care Systems CMS Announces Improved Efforts To Reduce Medicare Payment Error Rates
Motorcycles Remain Most Dangerous Vehicles
While travel by motor vehicle has become steadily safer in the United States, motorcycles remain the most dangerous type of motor vehicle to drive. Motorcyclists are involved in fatal crashes at a rate of 35.0 per 100 million miles of travel compared with a rate of 1.7 per 100 million miles of travel in cars. This study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) examined the association between alcohol impairment and fatal motorcycle crashes. Over the time period 1983 to 2003, the rate of fatal motorcycle crashes among alcohol-impaired drivers declined for drivers under 40 and rose for drivers over 40. The rate of fatal motorcycle crashes among alcohol-impaired drivers was highest among 20-24 year-olds in 1983 and among 40-44 year-olds in 2003. Because older drivers involved in fatal motorcycle crashes are more likely to be alcohol-impaired than younger drivers, future efforts to reduce alcohol-impaired driving among motorcyclists should include older drivers. Additional key findings include: The percentage of fatally injured motorcycle drivers who were alcohol-impaired declined from 1983 to 2003 in all age groups except the 55-59 years old age group. In 1983, 8.2% of the fatally injured motorcycle drivers with elevated blood alcohol concentrations (BAC) were aged 40 or older; by 2003, 48.2% of such drivers were in this age group. Motorcycle drivers in fatal crashes aged 40 and older were more likely to be alcohol impaired than car drivers aged 40 and older. Overall motorcycle mortality rates per 100,000 people declined from 1.6 in 1983 to 0.9 in 1993 and then rose to 1.2 in 2003. Rates for age groups under age 30 declined over this time period, whereas rates for age groups over 40 increased. Proven Community Strategies to Prevent Alcohol-Impaired Driving Include: Sobriety checkpoints 0.08% blood alcohol concentration laws Minimum legal drinking age laws Zero tolerance laws for young or inexperienced drivers School-based approaches to reduce riding with drinking drivers Management-supported intervention training programs for alcohol servers Mass media campaigns that are carefully planned and well executed, that attain sufficient audience exposure, and that are implemented in conjunction with other ongoing prevention activities

NHTSA Announces Discretionary Cooperative Agreements For Research Under The Crash Injury Research And Engineering Network (CIREN) The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) December 8 (69 FR 71101-71118) announced discretionary Cooperative Agreement opportunities to provide funding to Level One Trauma Centers in support of the Crash Injury Research and Engineering Network (CIREN). NHTSA anticipates funding these Cooperative Agreements in annual installments for one base year plus 4 one-year option years at NHTSA's option and subject to available funding. Due to budgetary constraints and the levels of effort applicants may propose, NHTSA is uncertain as to the number of Cooperative Agreements that will be funded. However, multiple awards will be made under this announcement. These cooperative agreements will support projects to improve the prevention, treatment, and rehabilitation of motor vehicle crash injuries to reduce deaths, disabilities and human and economic costs.
DATES: Applications must be submitted to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, Office of Contracts and Procurement (NPO-220), Attention: Dianne Proctor, 400 Seventh Street, SW., Room 5301, Washington, DC 20590. All applications submitted must include a reference to NHTSA Cooperative Agreement Program Number DTNH22-05-H-01001. Only complete packages received on or before 2 p.m. e.s.t. on February 8, 2005, will be considered for award. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: General administrative and programmatic questions may be directed to Dianne Proctor, Office of Contracts and Procurement, by e-mail at Diane.Proctor@nhtsa.dot.gov
or by phone at (202) 366-9562 and Karin E. Eddy, Office of Contracts and Procurement, by e-mail at Karin.Eddy@nhtsa.dot.gov
or by phone at (202) 366-9568. To allow for sufficient time to address questions appropriately, all questions must be submitted in writing no later 2 p.m. e.s.t., December 20, 2004, via e-mail to Karin.Eddy@nhtsa.dot.gov. Response to the questions will be posted on http://www-nrd.nhtsa.dot.gov/departments/nrd50/ciren/CIREN.html
by January 10, 2005 and in the Federal Register. The objective of the Cooperative Agreements is to fund CIREN Centers to add to the scope of data and expertise available and to increase CIREN's benefits to the public. NHTSA intends to award up to ten (10) Cooperative Agreements (depending on available funding at the time of award and the levels of effort proposed by the applicants) to support the goals of this initiative. Each Cooperative Agreement recipient will be expected to identify and coordinate an effort that supports the goals outlined in CIREN System Requirements. Subject to the availability of funds, it is anticipated that NHTSA will award up to ten (10) Cooperative Agreements to support the goals of this initiative for a period of five (5) years (i.e., one base year and four one-year Option Years, if exercised). Each Grantee will be expected to coordinate an effort that supports the goals outlined in the CIREN System Requirements. NHTSA anticipates that approximately three million dollars ($3,000,000.00) in total federal funding will be available for award of up to ten (10) Cooperative Agreements under this Federal Register Notice for the base year. Funding for each of the four (4) option years for each of the Grantees will be based on the availability of funds in future fiscal years. HRSA To Update State-By-State Self Assessments Of Trauma Care Systems The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) December 13 (69 FR 72204) to collect data from the 56 States and Territories on their current trauma care systems to assess progress since the initial survey in fiscal year 2002. This information will be used to establish a national strategy to assist in future grant opportunities to the States to improve or enhance their basic systems infrastructure in trauma care delivery, as well as their collection and usage of quality trauma data. HRSA will be collaborating with partners from within HRSA's Healthcare Systems Bureau, Division of Healthcare Preparedness (DHP), Bioterrorism Hospital Preparedness Program; HRSA's Office of Rural Health Policy; and HRSA's Maternal and Child Health Bureau. In addition, HRSA will collaborate with the Office of Public Health Emergency Preparedness; the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality; the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Center for Injury Prevention and Control; the National Highway Traffic and Safety Administration's Emergency Medical Services (EMS) Division; and affiliated professional organizations through the DHP Trauma Program's National Trauma-EMS Stakeholder Group. HRSA has included national performance measures for Trauma/EMS for this project in accordance with the requirements of the "Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) of 1993" (Public Law 103-62). This Act requires the establishment of measurable goals for Federal programs that can be reported as part of the budgetary process, thus linking funding decisions with performance. CMS Announces Improved Efforts To Reduce Medicare Payment Error Rates The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) December 13 announced new steps to measure error rates in Medicare payments more accurately and comprehensively at the contractor level, and to further reduce improper payments through targeted error improvement initiatives. "We have made significant strides in how we measure the error rate in Medicare payments, and that will enable us to do even more to bring it down,” said CMS Administrator Mark B. McClellan, M.D., Ph.D. “We have much better data that will help us pinpoint problems and allow us to work with the Medicare contractors and providers to make sure claims are submitted and paid properly." In addition, independent auditors for CMS issued an unqualified opinion on the agency’s fiscal year 2004 financial statements, which are required by the Government Management Reform Act. This year’s opinion marks the sixth consecutive year that CMS has received an unqualified opinion, demonstrating CMS’ stewardship, discipline and accountability in the implementation of its fiscal responsibilities Under the new measurement process for the Medicare error rate, the net national rate for fiscal year 2004 was 9.3 percent. The enhanced information comes from the first full year of data for an expanded program run by CMS to collect more detailed and contractor-specific information to help prevent future errors. CMS also announced new initiatives to reduce the error rate by more than half to 4 percent in four years, by building on recent reforms in payment oversight and new authorities in the Medicare law. Medicare pays more than 1 billion claims each year. In fiscal year 2004, CMS reviewed approximately 160,000 Medicare claims from the preceding year to learn, more precisely, where errors were being made. This review was the most extensive ever, providing CMS with more accurate information about contractor-specific error rates, error rates by provider type, and error rates by service type. This level of detail and accuracy is critical for CMS to identify where problems exist and target improvement efforts more effectively, and it reflects the agency’s increased commitment to use more detailed data and analysis to identify and eliminate improper payments. “We have developed the best data ever on contractor specific error rates,” said Dr. McClellan. “With this new and detailed information, we are now able to develop specific steps for the Medicare contractors to take more effective actions in reducing the error rates. Using this report and the new, comprehensive data, we can better manage our contractors, making them more accountable to the taxpayers, beneficiaries, and providers, and laying a foundation for the further contractor reforms that we intend to implement in the next few years.” The 2003 analysis identified a large and unexpected increase in the rate of non-responses. CMS adjusted the non-response rate based on past experience with non-responders and other error categories, reporting the 2003 adjusted error rate as 5.8 percent. Without adjusting for the non-response, the 2003 payment error rate would have been 9.8 percent. The 2004 data for error rate analysis was larger and more detailed than the 2003 data, just as the 2003 data was more extensive than data from previous years. Since 1996, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has annually determined the error rate for fee-for-service (FFS) claims paid by Medicare contractors, the insurance organizations that process and pay Medicare claims. From 1996 until 2002, the HHS Office of Inspector General (OIG) using a sample size of about 6,000 claims conducted the process used to measure Medicare payment error rates. The measured error rate declined from 13.8 percent in 1996 to 6.3 percent in 2002. In fiscal year 2003, and as part of the agency’s enhanced efforts to improve payment accuracy, CMS began calculating the Medicare FFS error rate and estimate of improper claim payments using a methodology approved by the OIG for the past two years. Since 2003, the OIG has assisted CMS in developing, reviewing, and formulating further actions based on the more extensive data collection. "The assistance provided by the Office of Inspector General is helping us improve our accuracy and effectiveness in identifying and responding to problems in paying claims,” said Dr. McClellan. “The majority of providers are honest and want to make sure they file their claims correctly so they can be paid timely, and we’re taking new steps to work with our contractors to make sure that happens, as we move forward with fundamental contractor reform over the next few years.” CMS’ more extensive survey, involving a more comprehensive analysis of a larger number and variety of claims, was accompanied by well-coordinated outreach to health care providers to improve claims submissions. CMS established two programs to monitor the accuracy of Medicare FFS payments: The Comprehensive Error Rate Testing (CERT) program and the Hospital Payment Monitoring Program (HPMP). The main objective of the CERT program and HPMP is to measure the degree to which CMS and its contractors are meeting the goal of “Paying it Right.” The 2004 analysis does not adjust the non-response rate, and also includes other data improvements that reflect input from Congress and other oversight partners. In particular, the sample of claims for fiscal intermediaries, who process and pay Medicare Part A claims, was doubled from the prior year so that intermediary-specific error rates could be calculated at the same levels as the Medicare carriers (Part B contractors) and durable medical equipment regional carriers. The data now permits accounting for appeals involving all types of benefits (not just hospital benefits). Thus, the more comprehensive error rates of the last 2 years are illustrative of CMS’ new measurement process. Of the total payments sampled in 2004, results of the new measurement program indicate the following payment error traits: 4.1 percent of payments had errors due to insufficient documentation being submitted (2.6 percent was reported in the 2003 analysis, which included much less information on fiscal intermediaries in 2003); 2.8 percent had errors due to non-responses to request for medical records (an unadjusted 5.0 percent rate was found in 2003); 1.6 percent had errors due to medically unnecessary services (1.3 percent in 2003); 0.7 percent had errors due to incorrect coding (0.7 percent in 2003); and the remaining 0.1 percent had other errors (0.2 percent in 2003). The claims included in this analysis were submitted before many of the agency’s recently-implemented initiatives to reduce error rates took effect. The more comprehensive data provides CMS with the opportunity to enhance and expand its efforts to monitor the impact of these initiatives. As part of its general efforts to further reduce the Medicare error rate, the CMS contractors will be required to: Develop corrective action plans that include efforts to educate providers about the importance of submitting thorough and complete medical records; Identify where additional review of claims and education on submitting claims is needed, based on information that shows where the highest percentage of errors on overused billing codes are occurring; and Use the performance results to develop local efforts to lower their error rates by addressing the cause of the errors and outlining corrective steps. "We've taken major steps in recent years to get much better data on payment accuracy for each and every one of our contractors, and in every case, better measures mean an ability to reduce error rate for those contractors,” said Dr. McClellan. “We've taken a major step this year to improve data on the fiscal intermediaries, and we are now using this information to drive down their error rates in the same way." In addition, CMS is continually developing educational material and information for healthcare providers as part as of "The Medicare Learning Network.” CMS has developed over 250 national provider education articles annually that outline, on a flow basis and in plain language, the coverage, billing and coding rules associated with Medicare program changes.

Wall Street Journal, 2/9/93: "The Most Dangerous Vehicle on the Road" by Walter Olson
  "The Most Dangerous Vehicle On the Road" By Walter Olson Wall Street Journal, February 9, 1993 Jury interviews suggest that last month's $ 105 million verdict in Moseley v. General Motors was based in part on anger at GM's unrepentance: Despite lawsuits and press reports fingering its 1973-87 trucks as unsafe, the company has refused to concede they are flawed at all. Soon after the verdict GM continued its defiance by counterattacking, charging that crash tests done for an NBC expose' in November were rigged by attaching incendiary devices to the trucks. Serious though these charges might seem, some have already dismissed them as GM damage control. Are the trucks, in fact, unsafe? Try to identify from this list the GM truck that Clarence Ditlow, director of the Center for Auto Safety, told NBC was a "rolling firebomb" and that NBC, summing up his charges, described as the "most dangerous vehicle out there on the road." Fatal Crash Rate (per 10,000 registered vehicle years) (National Highway Traffic Safety Administration)
A 1.162 B 1.446 C 1.514 D 1.652 E 1.824 F 2.212 G 2.347 H 2.455 The correct answer is C, the GM full-size vehicle in the Moseley case. (Seventeen-year old Shannon Moseley died in the fire after his GM truck was hit by a drunken driver.) Of the entries on the list with worse records, D represents passenger cars as a general average; E, F, G, and H, light pickup trucks from various makers (Ford, Nissan, Toyota, Chrysler). Of course, one must approach numbers of this sort with caution: For example, models bought by younger and more aggressive drivers may show higher crash rates through no fault of their design. Still, anyone who imagines the GM truck (1.514) an unconscionable death trap would also be wise to avoid the large majority of other vehicles on the road (1.652 to 2.455). Many analysts cry foul at comparing full-size pickups to smaller vehicles, since bigger is known to be safer as a general rule. In the litigation context, that's a strange cavil: If auto makers may freely offer small trucks to the public, why punish them for offering a large truck with a much better safety rating? But in any case, consider B, the full-size Ford entry, which was in fact the market's closest competitor to the GM model. (A, Dodge's full-size entry, did not score a hit with consumers, whatever its safety virtues.) Ford's very thin edge over the GM model may or may not represent anything more than statistical noise, driver bias, and so forth. Anyone who chooses to live in a wood rather than a brick house accepts a far wider adverse safety differential. One policy, of course, would be to punish any firm that fell behind in safety competition, as determined years later in statistical retrospect. That would ensure litigators a steady supply of provender, much as if, out on the veld, they were entitled to munch on whichever gazelles were at the rear of the pack. (The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety has acknowledged, by the way, that the current safety scare is unlikely to add materially to the premiums that GM truck owners pay; the accidents in question are far too rare.) When trial lawyers took their case to the general public through the media, they stressed intuition rather than statistics. It seems that GM, alone among auto makers, had gone about hanging gas tanks on the side of its trucks like dartboards, outside the protective frame rail. The tanks "were placed in about as stupid a place as they can possibly be placed," one of the plaintiff's lawyers informed "NBC Dateline." In a "side impact or a sideswipe impact, " plaintiff s expert Byron Bloch explained to a rapt NBC reporter, "the fuel tank gets crushed ... There is an immediate holocaust." So the overall numbers didn't matter. GM's design choice had invited specific, avoidable deaths, and the company must be punished. As it turns out, neither NBC nor most other news outlets bothered to report that the GM trucks have actually scored better over the years in avoiding fatal crashes when it comes to side-impact collisions, their presumed weak point. Specifically, the full-size GM trucks did slightly better (.196 fatal side-impact crashes per 10,000 registered vehicle years) than the comparable Fords (.200) and almost as well as the Dodges (.190), though the three are bunched so closely together that the numbers hardly matter. How on earth could these trucks have done better in side crashes, given that GM itself chose to move the tanks inboard in a 1988 redesign? Maybe the numbers are a fluke. Or maybe it's that the trade-offs in car safety are not well understood even by experts. Any possible placement of the fuel tank "causes" some accidents and averts others. Respectable designers have tried every gas-tank location at one time or another: front (as in old Volkswagen Beetles), rear (the Ford Pinto and many others), inside the passenger compartment (older trucks), or underneath (now usual, despite the hazards of flying gravel, sparks, ground-slams, and broken axles). All have been rejected at other times as unsafe. Maybe the distinctive narrow frame of GM trucks--popular with customers, but damned by the plaintiff's lawyers because it required the gas tanks to be placed outboard--offers some sort of obscure advantage in side crashes. It's hard to know. We do know that although you are apparently no more likely to have a fatal side-impact crash in your GM truck, if you do have one it is somewhat more likely to involve a fire. To that extent, intuition--but not the trial lawyers' case--is vindicated. We also know that in GM trucks, as in all other kinds, you are much more likely to die in a front-end than in a side crash, and vastly more likely to die in a crash without a fire than in one with. When fire is present in a fatal crash, it's often in the sort of high-force collisions that would have been lethal in any case--though the jury viewed the Moseley case as an exception. And--hardly a surprise given the statistics--it turns out that GM gas tanks are not exactly as fragile or exposed as DDT eggshells, as viewers might have concluded from watching the NBC video or trial lawyer's summations. The tanks not only complied with but far exceeded the U.S. government's safety standards, which specifically address the danger of gas-tank breakage in side crashes. (Fully obeying this kind of law, it turns out, will not keep you from getting sued.) In fact it takes about 4,000 side-impact crashes in a GM pickup to get one fire with a major injury or fatality, which means the supposed "rolling fire-bombs" may compare favorably with haystacks or mounds of feathers as objects to crash into. The more data we see on the safety record of existing cars, the more dubious the safety scares of the past begin to look. The Audi 5000 affair, in which one of the safest cars on the road was wrongly accused of "sudden acceleration," is only the best known of a whole series of lawsuit-driven campaigns that have collapsed in disgrace and refutation. Remarkably, even the affair of the "exploding" Ford Pinto--universally hailed as the acme of product liability success--is starting to look like hype. In a summer 1991 Rutgers Law Review article Gary Schwartz demolishes "the myth of the Pinto case." Actual deaths in Pinto fires have come in at a known 27, not the expected thousand or more. More startling, Schwartz shows that everyone's received ideas about the fabled "smoking gun" memo are false.  The actual memo did not pertain to Pintos, or even Ford products, but to American cars in general; it dealt with rollovers, not rear-end collisions; it did not contemplate the matter of tort liability at all, let alone accept it as cheaper than a design change; it assigned a value to human life because federal regulators, for whose eyes it was meant, themselves employed that concept in their deliberations; and the value it used was one that they, the regulators, had set forth in documents. In retrospect, Schwartz writes, the Pinto's safety record appears to have been very typical of its time and class. Ford, like GM, lost a $ 100 million verdict, although not much of that survived appeal. The scandal of punitive damages is that they're handed down with none of the due-process protections we'd accord targets charged with genuine criminal wrongdoing: strong screening of unreliable evidence, proof beyond a reasonable doubt, prosecution by independent professionals rather than interested parties, and so forth. Until we furnish such protection, punitive damages--as in the Moseley case--will threaten to make a travesty of justice. **** Walter Olson, senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, is the author of The Litigation Explosion.

  The most dangerous squad in Baghdad
By P. Mitchell Prothero
United Press International
Baghdad, Iraq, Jul. 7 (UPI) -- "How'd you end up with us, is this an embed?" the ridiculously young looking soldier asked me as we crouched on the roof of a power transformer station, surveying downtown Baghdad. He's peering down the sight of his belt-fed machine gun at a group of Iraqis located about 500 meters (yards) away towards the Tigris River when he realizes that they're armed. "Shit, shit, they have weapons," he yells across the roof at his corporal. "So fucking kill them," comes the pithy reply from the other ridiculously young solider. "Wait, wait. They're ICDC or ING or whatever the fuck they're called now," yells another. "They're with us." In the last week the Iraqi Civil Defense Corps has been renamed the Iraqi National Guard, a distinction that only means that the Iraqis will not be killed by the four man team that's protecting this impromptu command post. The roof is hot. Baghdad's high temperature on Wednesday is 118 degrees and the men of squad two, second platoon of the 1st Cavalry Division's 1-9 Regiment have already lost three men to the heat and it's only about half past noon. When told that I had just happened to hook up with their unit after being caught in the middle of a running gun battle in central Baghdad, one of the men laughs. "Well asshole, you just hooked up with the most dangerous squad in Baghdad," he says without looking up from his weapon, which is now trained on a small group of men several blocks away who are certainly not ING. Just what might be ordinary bravado from a young soldier echoes across the cement rooftop, his squad-mate clarifies. "No really we are," he says. "Out of the 11 of us, only two haven't won the Purple Heart in the last four months. It sucks to be us." He means that to be in his unit offers a nine out of 11 chance to be wounded in action. Having been quiet for the past 10 days as Iraq saw its sovereignty returned, insurgents picked the morning that the interim Prime Minister Iyad Allawi announced sweeping security measures that effectively allow him to declare martial law to stamp out Iraq's bloody insurgency to attack U.S. and ING forces in central Baghdad. Terror attacks are common in Baghdad. Insurgents attacking convoys and U.S. bases outside Baghdad are frequent. But masked gunmen running through central Baghdad in fire fights with police, ING and U.S. military is unheard of. It barely happened during the invasion of Iraq. The morning began with a mortar attack on Allawi's residence, which we couldn't get close enough to investigate. Then suddenly traffic became even worse than its typically insufferable level. And the sight of U.S. Apache attack helicopters sweeping on firing runs in downtown Baghdad indicated something major was happening. Having deftly avoided much of the traffic, my driver and I were looking for what was happening, expecting a cordon of military vehicles keeping us away from the action. What we didn't expect was that our deftness -- a result of my driver's surreal ability to avoid traffic jams -- would drive ourselves into the middle of a firefight. As bullets flew around our car, which was hastily abandoned, we ran for the shelter of a nearby hospital. We could see U.S. troops far down the broad boulevard. And there was a lot of firing, but we couldn't see who was shooting or at what. But we could hear the bullets smacking trees nearby the now abandoned car and U.S. troops at the end of the road weren't shooting or getting shot at, making the usual calculations of how to safely cover a firefight -- avoid the people getting shot at -- useless. Having decided that the car was a safer option than huddling and waiting to figure out who was doing the shooting, we broke for the car and headed for the nearest Iraqi Police station to find out what was going on. The police station was milling with police carrying assault rifles and some casually mentioned that they were currently under attack from unknown forces. But the shooting had just stopped, likely connected to the missiles fired from an Apache overhead and the black smoke pluming into the sky a few blocks away. Just as the Iraqis were trying to decide whether they were still under attack, three Bradley Fighting Vehicles of the 1st Cav. arrived and dumped three squads of infantry into the area. As they took up defensive positions, they uncharacteristically ignored me, probably due to gunfire directed on their positions. It wasn't well aimed and hit no one in the vicinity, but it caused the platoon leader to send out a squad to stop it. Walking the streets of Haifa -- the neighborhood -- was tense and full of intermittent gunfire, causing the squad to take a solid 30 minutes to travel just a handful of blocks. Having picked the power station as a base, it was checked and gunners assigned to the roof to protect both the station itself and provide supporting fire to a group of ING reportedly a few blocks away. They were pinned down by insurgents and had three wounded men. So several armored vehicles arrived with the rest of the platoon and a rescue mission planned in the small courtyard of the building. It was decided that the rescue operation -- headed to the building four blocks away -- would be done on foot. As the 1st Lieutenant commanding the platoon conferred over maps and with his company commander by radio, a hulking sergeant major addressed the men. "We are expecting resistance, this is full weapons on, men," he bellowed. "If you don't like it, soldier, then shoot it. Shoot boxes or anything you think might be an (improvised explosive device). They are expecting us." Setting out in long lines of men covering each side of the street, the soldiers faced not only the odd gunshot, threat of ambush, or, worse, a roadside bomb, but also the stares of Iraqis who were gathering outside their homes and shops to watch the deadly show. Some scowled, others waved, and the men of second platoon were not happy walking through a rough neighborhood of Baghdad in daylight with little armored vehicle support. And the Apaches had run out of fuel and retuned home so there was no air cover. But as they moved down a side alley along, little happened. Leaving the alley, they broke into the open and quickly established a defensive perimeter around the ING building. One squad ran for the entrance, as the others provided cover, only to find the building locked. "Open this door or I'll open it myself," one soldier yelled at a confused Iraqi man outside the building who clearly had no idea what he was talking about. The ING, it turns out, had already left, even remembering to lock up the facility. "I hate this shit," said the lieutenant. "We have terrible (communications) with the ICDC or ING, or whatever they are. I can't believe this." But even as the group withdraws, one soldier sees something a block away. And a report of men using a nearby house to stage attacks has just come through. Three doors are hit. The first two have only women and children. The third small building has 12 fighting age men in it. And all of their identification is suspicious enough that -- despite the absence of weapons -- it's decided to arrest them for questioning. So second platoon marches their 12 prisoners -- and a growing band of curious reporters -- back the vehicles. As they are loaded into armored vehicles for the ride back to the unit's forward operating base, one of the men manages to slip away and actually sits down at a café down the block pretending like he wasn't involved. A translator for one news organization notices and the reporter innocently asks one soldier why the man was let go. "Get that guy," cries the lieutenant, who then walks over to the café himself and grabs the man, who doesn't even try and deny anything. He just shrugs and follows his friends into the back of the vehicle. Moments later, rifle shots ring out as one soldier notices that the street down the block is now littered with cardboard boxes. He carefully puts a round through each one to make sure none holds a roadside bomb. "You can't be too careful in Baghdad," he shrugs. [UPI Perspectives]
